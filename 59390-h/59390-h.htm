<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Sir Rowland Hill, after his retirement from the
public service, as soon as prolonged rest had given
him back some portion of his former strength, satisfied
a mind which had always found its chief happiness
in hard work, by taking upon himself the task of
writing the history of his great postal reform. In a
“Prefatory Memoir” he gave, moreover, a sketch of
the earlier part of his life. It had been his hope that
he might live to bring out his book himself; but, for
reasons which the reader will find set forth in his
Preface,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he at last, though with reluctance, came to
the decision that the publication must be delayed till
after his death. Though he had, as it seemed, really
finished his work, and had even gone so far as to have
a few copies printed, yet he spent many an hour on its
revision. He went through it more than once with
the utmost care, sparing no pains to obtain complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
accuracy. In the year 1872 he asked me to examine
it carefully, and to point out whatever might strike me
as being defective either in its method or its execution.
I found, as I told him, that the “Prefatory Memoir”
was too short, and “The History of Penny Postage”
too long. Too little was told of the way in which his
character had been trained for the hard task which
awaited it, and too much was told of the improvements
which had been effected. In the case of inventors it
is not so much what a man does, as how he learns to
do it, and how he does it, that we all care to know.
We so soon come to think that what is has always
been, that our curiosity is not much excited about the
origin of the conveniences of modern life. Though
the improvements themselves we accept as a matter of
course, yet if in getting them adopted there was a
hard struggle with ignorance, routine, indifference, and
jealousy, then our interest is at once aroused. In his
book there were very many passages which I had read
with the strongest interest, containing as they did the
history of a great and a very curious fight. In these
there was scarcely any change that I could wish made.
But mixed up with these there were accounts of improvements
which, though important in themselves, were of
little interest to an outsider. I suggested, therefore,
that certain parts should be altogether struck out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
that others should be gathered either into one Appendix
at the end of the History, or into Appendices at the end
of the chapters. Though he did not by any means
adopt all my recommendations, yet he entrusted me
with the duty of writing the history of his early life.
In the course of the next few years he drew up many
interesting papers containing the recollections of his
childhood and youth. In this he was aided by his
brother Arthur, in whose mind, though he has seen
more than fourscore years, the past seems to live with
all the freshness of yesterday. These papers he put
into my hands some months before his death, and,
together with them, a large number of old letters and
a manuscript history of his life which he had begun to
write when he was but seventeen years old. In fact,
the abundance of the materials thus placed at my
disposal was so great, that my chief difficulty has been
to keep my part of the work at all within reasonable
limits.</p>

<p>If the “Prefatory Memoir” in which his early life
was told had really been an Autobiography, I might
well have hesitated, and hesitated long, before I
ventured to rewrite it. So much of a man’s character
is shown by his style, that even an imperfect
life written by himself will, likely enough, be of far
greater value than the most perfect life written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
another. But, as will be seen later on,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> so far as the
style goes, this Memoir was in no sense autobiographical.
It was, indeed, told in the first person; but
“I had,” he said, “to devolve upon another the task of
immediate composition.” I may add that his brother,
who thus assisted him, had not at his command many
of the materials which were afterwards placed at my
disposal. My uncle had not at that time wished that
a full account should be given of his early days, and
he had not, therefore, thought it needful to lay before
him either the letters or the fragment of an early
autobiography which I have mentioned above. He
had a strange unwillingness to let this history of his
youthful days be seen. In a memorandum which he
made a few years ago he says, “These memoirs of the
early part of my life having been written, for the most
part, when I was very young and ill-informed, contain
much which I have since known to be ridiculous; and
for this reason I have never shown them to any one—except,
I think, a small portion to my wife. After
some hesitation I have decided to preserve the
memoirs for any use to which my executors may
think proper to put them.” A far greater value is
added to them by the fact that the author intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
them for no other eye but his own. None of his
brothers, I believe, even knew that he was writing
them. He used, in late years, often to speak to me
about them; but it was only a short time before his
death that he could bring himself to let me read
them. When he gave them to me he bade me remember
that he was very young and ignorant when he
wrote them. “You must not,” he said, “judge me
harshly.” Happily I was soon able to tell him that,
though I had been a great reader of autobiographies,
there were few which had interested me more than
his. I found nothing to dispose me to ridicule, but
much that moved my pity, and still more that roused
my admiration.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say that the “Prefatory Memoir”
has been of great service to me in my task. It is not
for me to say how well it is written, or to praise the
work of one to whom I owe everything. I may, at
all events, acknowledge my debt. I have, as the
reader will see, largely drawn upon it. That it was,
however, imperfect—necessarily so, as I have shown—will
be at once recognised by any one who considers
how much I have quoted from my uncle’s Memoirs
and from the letters. It contained, for instance, no
mention of the visit to Edgeworth-Town, and not a
single extract from a letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>In giving so full an account of my grandparents
and of their home-life, I have borne in mind the saying
of Mr. Carlyle, that “the history of a man’s childhood
is the description of his parents and environment.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In a very large sense is this true of the
childhood of Rowland Hill. I have not dwelt so
much, as I should otherwise have done, on the
character of his eldest brother, towards whom he
felt himself indebted in so many ways. By “The
Life of Matthew Davenport Hill, the Recorder of
Birmingham,” by his daughters, I find myself forestalled
in this part of my work.</p>

<p>In my duty as Editor of “The History of Penny
Postage,” I have ventured not only here and there
on a verbal alteration, but also on considerable omissions,
and in some places, on a change of arrangement.
In fact, I have acted on the advice which I gave
eight years ago. I have gathered into Appendices
some of the less important matters, and I have thus
enabled my readers, as their tastes may lead them,
either to read the whole History, or, if they find
that too long, to follow a somewhat briefer but still
a connected narrative. In making changes such as
these I was running, I was well aware, a great risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of falling into serious errors. A reference, for instance,
might be left in to a passage which, by the
new arrangement, was either not given at all, or else
was found on a later page. I have, however, spared
no pains to guard against such blunders, trying
always to keep before me the high standard of strict
accuracy which the subject of my biography ever
set me.</p>

<h1>THE LIFE<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
SIR ROWLAND HILL.</h1>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Rowland Hill, the third son of Thomas Wright Hill
and Sarah Lea, his wife, was born at Kidderminster
on the third day of December, 1795. On both sides he
sprang from families which belonged to the middle-class,
but which, by the time of his birth, had somewhat
come down in the world. When he was presented
with the freedom of the City of London a few months
before his death, the Chamberlain informed him that
he belonged to a line which already twice before had
received that high distinction. Whether he could claim
kindred with Sir Rowland Hill of Queen Elizabeth’s
time, and with Sir Rowland Hill, the famous soldier of
the Peninsular War, I have no means of knowing. In
a fire which sixty years ago burnt down part of his
father’s house, many family deeds were destroyed, some
of which, he informed me, went back to the age of the
Tudors. He was not, however, without ancestors, who
justly raised in him a strong feeling of pride. His
father’s mother, Sarah Symonds, “had a common descent
with the family of Symons, or Symeon, of Pyrton, the
heiress of which branch married John Hampden.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
His father, who had many kinsmen of the name of
Butler, had been told in his youth that he was related
by blood to the author of “Hudibras.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> With these
two famous men his connection was but remote. But
both father and mother could tell the boy of nearer
and undoubted ancestors, who had shown, some of them,
strong independence of character, and one or two a
noble spirit of self-sacrifice. In the eloquent words of
Romilly, he might have said that “his father left his
children no other inheritance than the habits of industry,
the example of his own virtuous life, an hereditary
detestation of tyranny and injustice, and an ardent zeal
in the cause of civil and religious freedom.” With
perfect truthfulness he might have applied these words
to his mother also. The detestation of tyranny and
injustice, and the ardent zeal in the cause of civil and
religious freedom were, indeed, hereditary, in most of
the branches of his family. They were chiefly old
Puritan stocks, with much of the narrowness, but all
the integrity of the best of the Nonconformists.</p>

<p>His father had received a hurt in defending a house
against the brutal mob which, in the year 1791, burned
down in Birmingham the chapels and the dwellings of
unoffending dissenters. His grandfather, James Hill,
had shown his attachment to civil liberty in a curious
way. He was a baker in Kidderminster—“a substantial
freeholder,” as his son described him. He was
descended from a considerable landowner who had
married twice, and had left the children of his first wife
very much to shift for themselves. One of them had
settled in trade in Kidderminster.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> James Hill was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
grandson. In his time the bakers all heated their ovens
with faggots, which they bought of the neighbouring
squire. An election for the county came on; the
squire was one of the candidates, and the steward asked
James Hill for his vote. “My father,” his son records,
“could not bring himself to the expected compliance.
The result was that at the next faggot-harvest<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> his
application was refused, and he was thus put to great
inconvenience.” The baker, however, was an ingenious
man. Coals were cheap if faggots were dear. He
began by trying a mixture of coals and wood. He
found, by repeated trials, that he could go on lessening
the quantity of faggots and increasing the quantity of
coal. Other bakers profited by his experience, and
the faggots now lacked purchasers. “Applications
were made to him to know if he had no room for
faggots, from the quarter which had refused the
supply.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> James Hill’s brother, John, had enrolled
himself as a volunteer against the Young Pretender in
1745; for, like a famous brother-volunteer, Fielding’s
Tom Jones, “he had some heroic ingredients in his
composition, and was a hearty well-wisher to the
glorious cause of liberty and of the Protestant religion.”
He was once summoned to Worcester to serve on a
jury, when he alone of the twelve jurymen refused a
bribe. The judge, coming to hear of this, praised him
highly, and whenever he went the same circuit asked
whether he was to have the pleasure of meeting “the
honest juror.” Later on in life he became, like Faraday,
a Sandemanian, and was bound by conscience to a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of practical communism. He died in the year 1810, at
the age of ninety-one, and so was well known by
Rowland Hill and his brothers. It is a striking fact
that there should still be living men who can well
remember one who volunteered against the Young
Pretender.</p>

<p>James Hill’s wife was the grand-daughter of a medical
practitioner at Shrewsbury of the name of Symonds,
who had married Miss Millington, the only sister of a
wealthy lawyer of that town. An election for the
borough came on. The doctor refused to place his
vote at the disposal of his rich brother-in-law, the
attorney. “The consequence is,” writes Thomas Hill
“that Millington’s Hospital now stands a monument of
my great-grandfather’s persistence and his brother-in-law’s
implacability. Of this privation,” he adds, “my
mother used to speak with very good temper. She
said the hospital was a valuable charity, and she believed
that no descendant of her grandfather’s was the less
happy for having missed a share of the fortune bestowed
upon the hospital.” Through this lady Rowland Hill
was related to the Rev. Joshua Symonds, the friend
and correspondent of Howard and Wilberforce.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Such
were the worthies he could undoubtedly boast of on
his father’s side. There is no man among them whom
the world would reckon as famous; and yet I remember
how proud I felt as a mere child when my father
first told me of the “honest juror,” and of the forefather
who had lost a fortune by his vote. To such feelings
as these Rowland must have been susceptible in a
singular degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of his mother’s ancestors is more
romantic, but, perhaps, even more affords a just
cause for honest pride. Her grandmother’s name
was Sarah Simmons. She had been left an orphan
at an early age, and was heiress to a considerable
fortune. She was brought up by an uncle and
aunt, who were severe disciplinarians, even for the
time in which they lived. They tried to force her
to marry a man for whom she had no liking, and,
when she refused, subjected her to close confinement.
She escaped from their house in the habit
of a countrywoman, with a soldier’s coat thrown over
it. In those days, and much later also, poor women
in wet weather often wore the coats of men. She
set out to walk to Birmingham, a distance of some fifteen
miles. On the road she was overtaken by one of her
uncle’s servants, mounted on horseback, who asked of
her whether she had been passed by a young lady,
whose appearance he described. She replied that no
such person had passed her, and the man rode away,
leaving her rejoicing at the completeness of her disguise.
She reached Birmingham, and there supported herself
by spinning. To her fortune she never laid claim. At
the end of two years she married a working man named
Davenport. For thirteen years they lived a happy life,
when a fever broke out in the town, and carried off a
great number of people. One of her neighbours died
among the rest. The alarm was so great that no one
was found daring enough to go near the dead man’s
house. Mrs. Davenport, fearful that his unburied body
might spread the pestilence still more widely through
the neighbourhood, herself ordered his coffin, and with
her own hands laid him in it. Her devotion cost her her
life. In a few days this generous woman was herself
swept away by the fever. Her husband never held up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his head after her death, and in about a year was himself
carried to his grave. They left four children behind
them; the eldest a girl of thirteen. She showed herself
the worthy child of such a mother. From her she had
learnt how to spin, and by her spinning, aided no doubt
by that charity which the poor so bountifully show to the
poor, she managed to support herself and her brothers
until the two boys were old enough to be apprenticed to
trades. Then she went out to service in a farm-house.
She married her master’s son, whose name was William
Lea. He had been called out to serve in the militia
when it was raised on the landing of the Young
Pretender. He, like John Hill, the volunteer, lived
till he was past ninety, and, like him, was known by
kinsmen who are still living. Once he saved a poor
old woman from death by drowning, to which she had
been sentenced on a charge of witchcraft by a brutal
mob. Where the Birmingham cattle-market now is,
there was of old a piece of water known as the Moat.
In it he saw the unhappy woman struggling for her life,
and surrounded by a crowd as cruel as it was ignorant.
Being a powerful man he easily forced his way through,
leapt into the water, and brought the poor creature to
land. He took her home and kept her in his house for
some days till she had recovered her strength. Mrs.
Lea, according to her daughter, was a woman of considerable
information. She had been taught by her
mother by word of mouth as they sat spinning together,
and she, in her turn, in the same way taught her
daughter. Her views of political events were much wider
and more liberal than those of most of the people
round her. Her daughter often heard her condemn
the harsh policy of the mother-country towards our
settlements in America, and foretell as the result the
separation between the two that soon followed. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had had too heavy a burthen of care thrown on her when
she was still a child, and her health broke down almost
before she had reached middle life. She died when
her daughter Sarah, Rowland Hill’s mother, was but
fifteen. The young girl had for some years, during
her mother’s long illness, taken upon herself the chief
part of all the household duties. At the same time she
had been a most devoted nurse. For most of her life
she was troubled with wakefulness. She had, she said,
formed the habit when she was a mere child, and used to
lie awake in the night fearing that her sick mother might
require her services. She had a brother not unworthy
of her. He settled in Haddington, where the name of
Bailie Lea was long held in respect. When the cholera
visited that town in 1832 he was found “fearlessly assisting
all who stood in want of aid.” In the houses on both
sides of him the dreadful disorder raged, and at length
his own servant was struck down. The old man showed
no signs of fear, but bore himself as became the grandson
of the woman who had lost her life by her devotion
to the public good when the fever raged in Birmingham.</p>

<p>In the short account that I have thus given of Rowland
Hill’s kindred, there is seen much of that strong
sense of duty, that integrity, that courage, and that
persistency which in so high a degree distinguished him
even from his very childhood. There are but few signs
shown, however, of that boldness of thought and fertility
of mind which were no less his mark. These he inherited
from his father. Thomas Wright Hill was, indeed,
as his son said of him, a man of a very unusual
character. I have never come across his like, either
in the world of men or books. He had a simplicity
which would have made him shine even in the pages of
Goldsmith. He had an inventiveness, and a disregard
for everything that was conventional, that would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
admirably fitted him for that country where kings were
philosophers, or philosophers were kings. He had,
his friends used to say, every sense but common-sense.
He was the most guileless of men. He lived fourscore
years and eight, and at the end of his long life he
trusted his fellow-men as much as he had at the beginning.
His lot had been for many years a hard one.
His difficulties had been great—such as might have
well-nigh broken the heart of many a man. “If ever,”
he once wrote, “that happy day shall arrive when
we can pay off every account as presented, we should
fancy ourselves in a terrestrial Paradise.” He longs “to
accelerate the arrival of that blessed hour, if that be
ever to come, when I shall be able to say, ‘I owe no
man anything but love.’” Yet he had always been
cheerful. When death one winter came upon his
household, and carried off his youngest son, he wrote,
“Christmas, for the first time, as far as I can remember,
comes without a smile.” He had by this time seen
sixty-eight Christmases, and at one period of his life,
poverty had been an unfailing guest at his board. He
had inherited from his father, as he said, a buoyant
spirit of optimism which carried his thoughts beyond
all present mishaps. He never spoke ill of the world.
Like Franklin, he said on his death-bed that he would
gladly live his days over again. His relish of life had
even at the last lost but little of its keenness. Yet he met
his death with the most unruffled calmness, and with
profound resignation. I account myself happy in that
he lived to such an age, that I was able to know
him well. The sitting-room in the house where he
spent his last years faced, indeed, the south. The sun
could not, however, every day have shone in at
his window. Nevertheless in my memory it seems
as if the aged man were always seated in perpetual
sunshine. How much of the brightness and warmth
must have come from his own cheerful temperament!</p>

<p class="caption">THOMAS WRIGHT HILL.</p>
<p class="caption">(FATHER OF SIR ROWLAND HILL.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>When at the age of fourteen he left the Grammar
School of his native town, he was apprenticed to one of
his uncles, a brass-founder in Birmingham. It had
been at one time his strong wish to be articled to an
attorney; but “his good mother was incredulous as to
the possibility of a lawyer and an honest man being
united in the same person.” His eldest son, the late
Mr. Matthew Davenport Hill, said that his father had
many of the qualities which make an able lawyer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He had what is known in the profession as a good head for law.
He was quick at discovering distinctions, possessed logical powers,
both strong and subtle, and a memory exceedingly retentive: while
his language was at once lucid and accurate. In conversation he
was a fluent speaker, and with early practice doubtless would have
learnt to make fluent speeches; but I do not think he could ever have
brought himself to utter an unnecessary word.”</p>

</div>

<p>He used to read with eagerness all law books that
came in his way, and was, says his son, better informed
on all matters pertaining to the law than almost any
layman he ever met with. I greatly doubt, however,
whether as a lawyer he could have made his way.
When he was in his seventieth year, his son was
counsel in a political trial, where the judge so far forgot
his position on the bench, as in summing-up to speak
of the learned gentleman who was opposed to him.
“Thanks to God,” wrote the old man on hearing of the
case, “that it is not my profession to plead before such
judgment-seats. I should ruin the best of causes by
unbridled indignation.” With his eager and impatient
mind, with his love for “the divine principle of utility,”
he would never have borne “the tyranny of lawyers,”
which was, to use Gibbon’s words, “more oppressive
and ridiculous than even the old yoke of the clergy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving school as he did at an early age his education
was but imperfect. Nevertheless in his Calvinistic home
he had studied one book thoroughly, and that was the
Bible. Its beautiful language was ever at his command.
On Sunday afternoons, while he was still a child, it had
been his father’s wont to entertain him and his brother
with Scripture stories told in homely words. “The story
of Gideon,” wrote the old man, more than eighty years
later, “was a great favourite, and ecstatic was the
moment when my father came to narrate the breaking
of the jugs, the sudden blaze of the lamps, and the
accompanying shout of the watchword—‘The sword of
the Lord, and of Gideon.’” The child used to delight in
reading the Latin quotations in Stackhouse’s “History of
the Bible.” He did not understand them, but he found
pleasure in the melody of the words. Later on at
school he acquired a fair knowledge of Latin and some
knowledge of Greek, but he was removed at too early
an age to become much of a scholar. Like many another
youth of those days eager after knowledge, he had but
few books at his command. Even his copy of Robinson
Crusoe was but a fragment. It began, as he vividly
recollected, with the words “‘More than thirty dancing
round a fire,’ by which,” he wrote, “those who are
familiarly acquainted with that fascinating book will perceive
how dreadfully my copy had suffered mutilation.”
A friend of his father’s—a man of secluded habits and of
a studious turn of mind, and therefore set down by some
of the good people of Kidderminster as being in league
with the Evil One—knowing that the boy was fond
of reading, bequeathed to him two volumes. One of
the trustees wished to have them burnt at once, as they
bore a suspicious appearance and came from a dangerous
quarter. “My father,” wrote his son, “who was somewhat
less credulous than his neighbours, said, ‘Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
let the boy have them;’ whereupon were put into my
hands a ‘Manual of Geography,’ and a copy of ‘Euclid’s
Elements.’” On Euclid he at once fastened, and soon
mastered it. He went on to algebra and the higher
mathematics. To astronomy he devoted himself with
an ardour that never flagged. When he was eighty-four
years old he repaired with his telescope to
Willingdon that he might observe the great eclipse of
the sun of the year 1847. To this eclipse he had
long been looking forward, but unhappily he was disappointed
by a cloudy sky. Even within a month or
two of his death he was engaged in framing a system
of nomenclature for the stars.</p>

<p>His settlement at Birmingham was, in one way, most
fortunate. It brought him under the instruction of
the excellent Priestley. He left the strict and narrow
sect in which he had been brought up, and joined a
congregation which its pastor, perhaps with justice,
described as the most liberal of any in England. He
became an orthodox Unitarian. “For about five years
I had,” as he said on his death-bed, “great privileges
in the pastoral services of Dr. Priestley, and especially
in his lectures to the younger members of his congregation,
and in occasional conversations with him. This
delightful period was closed by the Birmingham riots.”
The philosopher could not but have liked his thoughtful
and high-minded disciple. In fact, Thomas Hill was
heard to say, with not a little pride, that when he had
once made some request of Priestley, he received as
answer, “You know, Hill, I never can refuse you
anything.”</p>

<p>Rowland Hill said that through his father he himself
owed much to Priestley as a teacher of politics and
science. To him as a teacher of religion he acknowledged
no obligation. From Priestley Thomas Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
got, no doubt, an increased relish for the study of
Natural Philosophy. When he was a child of nine,
he had been present at some of Ferguson’s lectures.
Much that he had heard and seen had been beyond his
understanding, but “some parts of the lecturer’s apparatus
were,” as he said, with a memory that had with
the flight of nearly eighty years lost none of its freshness,
“delightfully comprehensible.” He gradually acquired a
considerable knowledge of most of the branches of
Natural Philosophy, and what he knew he knew
thoroughly. On some of these subjects he lectured at
the Birmingham Philosophical Institution, and lectured
well. He did not, however, servilely follow authority.
So early as 1807, and perhaps earlier, writes his son,
“he emphatically protested against the use of the term,
‘electric fluid,’ (substituting that of ‘electric influence,’)
and against the Franklinian theory of positive and
negative electricities.”</p>

<p>His favourite study, next to astronomy, was the
formation of our letter-sounds, and here he was under
no obligation, either to Priestley, or, so far as I know,
to anyone else. In a lecture that he delivered before
the Institution so early as 1821, he established the
distinction between vocal and whispered sounds. It
is to him that Dr. Guest, the learned master of Caius
College, Cambridge, refers in the following passage in
his “History of English Rhythms.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “The distinction
here taken between vocal and whisper letters appears
to me important. I once thought it was original; but
in conversing on this subject with a respected friend,
to whose instructions I owe much, I found his views so
nearly coinciding with my own, that I have now but
little doubt the hint was borrowed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>For years he laboured at a philosophic system of
short-hand. It never came into general use, nor, with
all its ingenuity, was it likely to do so. For were brevity
set on one side, and philosophy on the other, he would
not have hesitated for a moment in his choice. His
hand should be as short as philosophy allowed, but not
one whit shorter. “After nearly half-a-century of
thought, and many a year of labour,” he wrote to one
of his sons, “I have, as I think, succeeded beyond my
most sanguine expectations in constructing a short-hand.
Cast your eye over it, and observe the distinctness of
the elementary characters—the graceful shape of the
words—the perfect continuity of every combination as
to the consonants—the distinctness of the lines resulting
from the lineality of the short-hand writing. The art
rests almost wholly in myself, and it is, my dear fellow,
too good, I feel sure, to be lost now so perfect.” In a
later letter, written in the spring of the year in which
the great Reform Bill was carried, he says, with a
charming and touching simplicity of character not unworthy
of Don Quixote himself, “Were <span class="smcap">The Bill</span> once
passed, one might hope for general amendment. Then
should I think seriously of publishing my short-hand,
which I am sure is a good thing. The more closely I
compare my own system with others, the more I like it.”</p>

<p>It was not vanity that led him to wish for the spread
of his short-hand. He was not, indeed, insensible to
fame, but the ruling passion that was strong in him to
the very end of his life was the love of his fellow-men.
In one letter he speaks of “the divine principle of
divided labour;” in another he prays that “the divine
principle of utility may be carried into every corner of
human practice.” There might justly be applied to
him the words that he himself used of a friend:
“He had a matchless benevolence—an interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
happiness of others.” His youngest son’s death was a
dreadful blow to him. “The vacancy,” he wrote,
“seems appalling.” One brother was lying dead at
home, another had fallen ill in London. The old
father feared that some “inconsiderate expression of
impatience” of his, written before the news had reached
him of his son’s illness, might have increased his fever.
“You must forgive one who knew not what he did.”
In the midst of all his sorrow and anxiety he found
no small comfort. His beloved child had lived to see
the beginning of good times. “The French Revolution
(of 1830,) and the change of ministry to a liberal complexion,
he had to rejoice in, and this affords us great
consolation.” So, too, his private troubles were at
another time overwhelmed beneath the greater troubles
of his country. “Our family trials,” he writes, “merge
completely in the sad prospects for our country.”</p>

<p>At the age of forty he had left trade, for which he
was but little fitted, and had opened a school. One of
the ablest among his pupils thus describes him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Old Daddy,’ as he was afterwards more familiarly called, was one
of the kindest and most upright men I ever knew: irascible as became
his profession: tender-hearted: intelligent, and reflective: imbued with
the liberalism which is now predominant: of moderate scholastic
attainments, having indeed been originally engaged in some small
business; but resolute in making his boys understand whatever he
taught them.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He had, indeed, some high qualifications for the
schoolmaster’s life. His “great and pure simplicity”—I
use the words of another of his pupils—could not but
win the hearts and ennoble the characters of all who
were under him. He was, wrote a third, “a genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man, to whom, if to any of the children of men, may be
applied the emphatically Christian praise, that ‘He
was an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile.’”
On his simplicity his boys could easily impose, but
though they tricked him, they never ceased to respect
him. The morality of his school was, on the whole,
high. It was, above all, distinguished by great truthfulness
and honesty. Certainly, in one respect, he was
an excellent teacher. He was, as Mr. Sargant says,
resolute in making his boys understand whatever he
taught them. He was altogether free from one of the
worst, and one of the commonest, faults of a teacher.
He never confounded rules with reasons. He cared
far more that his pupils should understand <i>why</i> a thing
is done, than <i>how</i> a thing is done. “His explanations
of the first principles in mathematics,” says one of his
pupils, “were very clear.” From this same gentleman
I learn that not a little that is now taught as new in
the modern system of geometry had been taught him
by his old master. A week before his death he mentioned
with satisfaction, that a definition which he had
given of a straight line had been pronounced by a
mathematician to be the best that existed.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“He looked,” as I have been told by one who was long
under him, “at the bearings of every subject, irrespective
of its conventionalities. In every case he would be
asking, ‘If we were to begin the world afresh, how
should we proceed?’ He would always consider what
is the best thing to be done, and next how can it be
done irrespectively of everything conventional. When
he had once arrived at his conclusions, and laid down
his principles, he would carry them out without regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to anyone or anything.” Yet he was as free from
arrogance as any man could well be. He had an old-fashioned
courtesy which never forsook him even when
he caned an unruly boy. Towards women, towards
children, towards the oppressed, towards the poor, in a
word towards those who were weaker than himself, he
bore himself like a second Knight of La Mancha, or
another Colonel Newcome. Nevertheless he was not
a good teacher. He had at least one great failing.
He was wanting, as one of his sons has said, in mental
perspective. There was no “keeping” in his mind. In
the image that he formed to himself of the world of learning,
all things seemed to be equally in the foreground.
He could not distinguish between the relative values of
the different branches of study. All kinds of knowledge
ranked in his eyes as of equal importance. He was,
for instance, an excellent teacher of correct pronunciation
and clear articulation. “We were,” says Mr. Sargant,
“thoroughly taught the elements of English; and our
spelling was immaculate.... The dropping of an
‘h’ was one of the seven deadly sins.” He had a quick
ear for melodious and rhythmical sounds. In writing
of the year 1770, he said, “It was a date which I found
no pleasure in expressing. The previous year, 1769,
was that in which I first became acquainted with the
way of distinguishing years by their number, and I was
well pleased with the metrical expression of the number
first learnt. That of the subsequent 1770 ended in
what my ear felt as a bathos, and I longed for the
metrical restoration of 1771.” He was not seven years
old when 1770 thus distressed him. He used to tell how
as a child he had been delighted with the name Melinda,
and how he used to repeat it again and again. His
ear was grievously offended by what he called a
collision. There was a collision when two like sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
came together. When his boys repeated the multiplication
table they had to speak euphoniously. A collision
here would have been a most serious offence. They said
five sixes are thirty, but five times five is twenty-five.
Five fives would have set their master’s teeth on edge,
as Dean Gaisford’s were set by a wrong Greek accent.
“Your old friend, Mr. A——,” he wrote to his eldest
son, “has sent No. 1. of his Birmingham—m—m—Mercury.
I hope more skill and more taste will appear in
the selection of materials than has been evinced in the
choice of a name.” In returning home from the lectures
that he gave at the Philosophical Institution—and very
good lectures they were, too—he would with pride draw
the attention of his friends to the fact that they had not
heard that night one single collision. “He used to
delight,” as his son once told me, “in peculiar terms,
and would amend Euclid’s language. Thus, instead of
allowing the boys to say ‘the lines are at right angles
to each other,’ he taught them to say, ‘the lines have
a mutual perpendicularity.’ To my great annoyance
the boys made a catch-cry of this, and I could hear
them shouting out in the playground, ‘the lines have
a mutual perpendicularity.’”</p>

<p>He had devised an admirable plan for curing stammering,
and here he was as successful in practice as in
theory. He never failed to work a cure, but he had to
complain that “strange as it might appear, it was frequently
much more easy to induce the capacity for
speaking without stammering than the inclination.”
The regard that he paid to mere utterance was, however,
so excessive that the general progress of his pupils
was greatly retarded. He took months to carry a class
through numeration, for, fond though he was of mathematics,
he paid more attention to the modulation of the
voice when the figures had to be expressed aloud in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
words, than to the figures themselves. He took the
class up to decillions. Why he stopped there it was
not easy to see. It was no slight task to get a Midland
County lad to express, with a correctness that would
satisfy the master’s ear, a number far smaller than a
decillion. When he had learnt the arithmetical value
of the figures, when he had been taught to say
<i>hundred</i>, and not <i>underd</i>, <i>nine</i> and not <i>noine</i>, <i>five</i> and
not <i>foive</i>, the modulation of the whole sentence remained
as a vast, but not, as he at length found, an
insuperable task. If far too much time was wasted,
no small good was thus done. His pupils were
always known by the distinctness and correctness
of their utterance.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, very fond of forming theories, but he
too often forgot to test them by practice. Having once
convinced himself by a process of reasoning that they
were sound, he did not think it needful to put them to
the proof. He was also in this part of his character
like Don Quixote, who, when he had found that his
pasteboard helmet did not bear the blows of his sword,
having patched it up, was satisfied of its strength, and,
without putting it to a second trial, looked upon it as a
most finished piece of armour. When he came to
build his new school-house he showed his love of theory
in a curious way. “My father,” wrote his son, “having
found that, with but slight deviation from the line of
road, the house might be made to stand in exact
coincidence with the cardinal points, would, I believe,
from that moment, have been almost more willing to
abandon the scheme than to lose such an opportunity of
gratifying his taste.” Now most men when they build a
house, build it to serve, not as the letters on a vane to
show the points of the compass, but as a place of
residence. A place of residence is certainly not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
better, but a good deal the worse, for standing in exact
coincidence with the cardinal points.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his faults as a schoolmaster, he was,
in many ways, admirable as a father. His children could
say of him what Burns said of his father:—“He conversed
familiarly on all subjects with us, as if we had
been men.” “Perhaps,” wrote Mr. M. D. Hill, “after
all, the greatest obligation we owe to our father is this:
that from infancy he would reason with us—argue
with us, would perhaps be a better expression, as
denoting that it was a match of mind against mind, in
which all the rules of fair play were duly observed; and
we put forth our little strength without fear. Arguments
were taken at their just weight; the sword of authority
was not thrown into the scale.” He did not much
delight to season his fireside with personal talk. It
was all those matters that make up the life of a good
citizen in a free state that he mostly discussed. In
subjects such as these, time has proved that he was no
fanciful theorist. Strong and staunch Liberal though
he always was, in no single respect was he ever a man
of violent or extreme views. He never was a Republican.
The news of the opening scenes of the French
Revolution had, indeed, been to him glad tidings of
great joy. But the horrors of the Reign of Terror he
never forgot or condoned. They did not scare him
however from the path of reform. Unlike many of the
Whigs, he always hated Bonapartism. He had, indeed,
condemned as much as any man the conduct of England
when in 1793 she joined the confederacy against France.
He could never forgive Pitt his share in that proceeding.
But when Bonaparte wantonly broke through the
Peace of Amiens, and renewed the war, he was dead
against him. He would have said with Southey, that
had he only a single guinea in the world, he would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rather than see peace made for want of funds, give half
of it in war-taxes. “My own wish,” he wrote in 1807,
when the fear of a French invasion was still in the minds
of men, “is that every man and every boy throughout
the United Islands should be compelled, under a penalty
that would be submitted to for conscience sake alone—that
each should be compelled to provide himself with
arms, and learn to use them.” He had his children
and his pupils drilled. He was above all things a
sturdy Englishman. But he longed for reforms—reforms
of all kinds, but reforms that kept well within
the lines of the Constitution. Above all he longed for
a thorough reform of Parliament, as the fount and source
of all other reforms. In that gloomiest of all years,
1811, he wrote, “a Parliamentary reform, a strong
effusion of the healthy vigour of Democracy, is the only
hope.” Six years later, writing to his eldest son, he
says, “You will see that I have not lost sight of the
excellent maxim—‘The whole man must stand or fall
together.’ If your father cannot get rich without
fawning, he must remain poor. If he cannot live
without it, he must die, as by far the easiest alternative.
Your account of London is appalling. But
the land, the sunshine, the rain on our planet are as
ever. Why then despair? The political heavens
lower; but who shall say of what force the storm shall
be, and of what duration? Who shall predict ravages
too great to be compensated by succeeding seasons of
calm? Let us not fear for ourselves—little indeed is
needful to life—let us fear for our beloved country,
and each to his utmost so trim the bark as to avoid
the rocks of anarchy on the one hand, and the equally
fatal, though less conspicuous, shoals of despotism on
the other. The time is coming, I apprehend, when
none that carries a conscience will be able to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
neuter.” He had in political matters that reasonableness
which is the mark of the best English mind. When in
1819 the proposal had been made that the franchise of
Grampound should be transferred to some large town,
he wrote, “Cobbett and Co. would persuade the multitude
to despise the boon as falling far short of what
should be granted, and thus they furnish the foes of all
reform with a pretence for withholding this trifling, but
far from unimportant, concession.”</p>

<p>Evil, indeed, were the days in which the vigour of
his manhood was spent, and gloomy ofttimes must have
been the family talk. But amid all the gloom there
was no despondency. He belonged to that hopeful
but small band of brave men who amid the darkest
days of the long Tory rule steadfastly held up the
banner of freedom and progress. He did his best to
train up his children as soldiers in the good cause.
Recruits were indeed needed. The government was
the most oppressive that there had been in England
since the days of the Stuarts, while the upper and
middle classes were sunk in an indifference that had not
been witnessed since the evil times of the Restoration.
“If any person,” wrote Romilly in 1808, “be desirous
of having an adequate idea of the mischievous effects
which have been produced in this country by the
French Revolution and all its attendant horrors, he
should attempt some legislative reform, on humane
and liberal principles. He will then find, not only
what a stupid dread of innovation, but what a savage
spirit it has infused into the minds of many of his
countrymen.” There were scarcely any Reformers left
in Parliament. The great Whig party was either
indifferent or hopeless. The Criminal Law was everywhere
administered with savage severity. The Bishops,
with the Archbishop of Canterbury at their head, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ready to hang a poor wretch for the crime of stealing
goods that were worth five shillings. The royal dukes
fought hard for the slave trade. The Habeas Corpus
Act was suspended, and honest men were left to
languish in prison.</p>

<p>Such were the evil days in which Thomas Hill
brought up his children, and such were the evil deeds
which were ever rousing his fiercest anger. The
savageness of the penal code he hotly denounced. He
had heard of the execution of a man whom he had
known for a crime which no one now would dream of
punishing with death. “I feel only compassion,” he
wrote, “for the poor sufferer. Institutions more
atrocious than his crimes have exacted from him a ten-fold
forfeit, and he now is the injured party. It is a
consolation for me to have abhorred the Draconian
statutes even from my boyhood.” Slavery and the
slave-trade, and religious oppression of every kind,
whether carried out by law or by custom, he utterly
loathed and detested. “We were all,” said one of his
sons, “born to a burning hatred of tyranny.” He was
too poor to take in a newspaper by himself, but he
joined with three or four of his neighbours in subscribing
to a London weekly journal. It was always
read aloud in the family circle. The sons caught almost
from their infancy their father’s ardent love of liberty.
“He tuned their hearts, by far the noblest aim.” One
of them could remember how, when he was a child, an
account of a trial was read aloud by his eldest brother.
“I underwent,” he writes, “considerable excitement in
its recital, caused principally, as I recollect, by the
spirited manner in which the defendant, who employed
no counsel, resisted all attempts to put him down. My
father’s enthusiasm, I remember, was so strong as to
draw from him the wild exclamation, ‘Why the man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a god!’” This enthusiasm he retained through life.
“Beg of Arthur,” he wrote to one of his sons, on
tidings coming of the Battle of Navarino, “not to get
over-intoxicated with the Greek news. I bustled home
to make him quite happy, and, on inquiring for him
out of breath, found he had started.” I remember
well how I used to read aloud to the old man, now in
his eighty-seventh year, the accounts of the Hungarian
Insurrection, and how deep were his groans over the
defeat of the patriots, and how burning was his indignation
at the cruelties of the Austrians and the
Russians.</p>

<p>It was not merely a spirit of freedom that he implanted
in his children. In the midst of his enthusiasm
he never failed to consider the best cure for the evils
which he attacked. He was a diligent reader of Adam
Smith. “What he read he was fond of giving forth
and discussing, willingly listening to objections, and
never leaving them unanswered.... Our whole
family might be regarded as a little political economy
club, sitting not indeed at stated times, but yet at short
intervals, and debating, if not with much method, yet
with great earnestness. He was,” added his son, “in
political matters always right. As long as his children
could remember he was a thorough free-trader. He
condemned all laws against usury. He laughed at all
social objections to the employment of machinery.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He
strongly condemned the judge-made law which involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in partnership all persons who were paid for the use of
capital by a share in profits, and foresaw the benefits to
be derived from a general system of limited liability.
He was earnestly in favour of the representation of
minorities, and about sixty years ago drew up a plan for
effecting this, which was in substance the same as that
lately promulgated, and, indeed, independently devised,
by Mr. Hare.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He maintained the justice of allowing
counsel to address the jury for the defence in trials
for felony, and even of receiving the evidence of
parties.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He filled the minds of his children with
a passion for sweeping away injustice, and baseness,
and folly from the face of the earth. To apply to
him his own words, “he invigorated their souls for
the conception and accomplishment of many things
permanently great and good.” He was cheered by
the great changes for the better which he lived to
see. “Surely,” he once wrote, “the days of routine
and mummery are swiftly passing away.” A few
months before the Reform Bill was carried he wrote to
one of his sons:—“Even I hope to see mighty changes
wrought. You, my dear boy, may hope to enjoy the
beneficial effects of them. For myself it will be amply
sufficient if I can die assured that my dear children will
reap even the first-fruits of that harvest for which we
have all been thus long labouring.”</p>

<p>Dear as his memory is to me, yet I cannot but own
that his character had its imperfect side. It was not
only that he allowed himself to be mastered by his
theories. There was, moreover, a want of thoroughness
in much that he did. He never could satisfy
himself that he had done all which could be done, and
so he rarely brought anything to completion. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
readier to conceive than firm to execute. He worked
slowly, and was too much inclined to put off to another
day any piece of business which he much disliked. He
lived, indeed, with great simplicity; but, owing in part
to his own bad management of business matters, he
was never able to shake himself free from a burden of
debt till his sons came to his help. It is, perhaps, not
wonderful that he took the world somewhat easily, as
he had from nature such a happy constitution, that the
more he was troubled, the longer and the more soundly
he could sleep.</p>

<p>His, indeed, was a temperament that wins a man
happiness, but refuses him fame. He had little ambition
and few wants. His utmost wishes scarce travelled
beyond a simple house, a sufficiency of homely
fare and clothing, a good library, and a set of philosophical
and astronomical instruments. “Never be
cast down,” he wrote to one of his sons; “moderate
success is nearly a certainty, and more is not worth a
wish.” It was not that he lived the sour life of an
anchorite. Few men had a heartier relish of all honest
pleasures. He was even famed for his love of apple-pie.
“My dear,” I have heard him say after the
simplest of meals, when asked by his daughter whether
he had enjoyed his food, “My dear, I only hope the
Queen has had half as good a dinner.” Such hospitality
as he could afford he at all times delighted in
showing. Who that partook of his Sunday morning
breakfasts could ever forget the charming courtesy and
the warmth of affection that make the aged man’s
simple parlour live in the memory like a landscape of
Claude’s?</p>

<p>The love that he had ever borne his fellow-men
came to the relief of the sufferings of his last hours.
As he was dying, the gloom that had covered the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
during so much of his manhood seemed to him at last
to have been cleared away. The Great Exhibition of
1851 had just been opened. “Thank God! thank
God!” he said, “for living to see this day!...
This real peace meeting. I cannot join them with my
voice, but I can in my heart. ‘All people that on
earth do dwell, Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.’
I leave the world bright with hope. Never, surely,
has God’s government of the world been so clear as at
the present period.” The day before his death he
insisted that one of his sons and his doctor should
breakfast in his room, as, though he was himself unable
to eat, he took pleasure in seeing others eat and refresh
themselves.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the last evening, when his long life of fourscore
years and eight was almost at its lowest ebb, the love for
his fellow-men that had thrown a radiance on his whole
life was not dim, nor was the natural force of his mind
abated. “I shall sadly miss,” his son recorded in his
journal, “his warm and intelligent sympathy. Nothing
was so acceptable to him, even up to the time of my
visiting him last night, as an account of any improvements
in progress in the Post-office.” A few days
earlier he had exclaimed that he could not have believed
that a death-bed could be so pleasant. He knew nothing
of that melancholy state when life becomes a burthen
and death remains a dread. Much of his happiness
arose, he said, from his full confidence in the benevolence
of the Creator. He composed the following
lines:—</p>

<p>“His last parting with this world was to take one by
one the hand of each of his children, and, after
placing it near his heart, to kiss it, and point upwards
with a radiant expression of intense love and
happiness.”</p>

<p>Much as Rowland Hill owed to his father, he owed
scarcely less to his mother. She, though the inferior of
her husband in quick intelligence and originality, was
his superior in shrewd common sense and in firmness
of purpose. She was as practical as he was
theoretical, and as cautious as he was rash. To his
father Rowland owed his largeness of view and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
boldness of conception. But it was his mother from
whom he derived his caution, his patience, and his
unwearying prudence. Had he not had such a father,
he would not have devised his plan of Penny Postage.
Had he not had such a mother, he would not have
succeeded in making what seemed the scheme of an
enthusiast a complete and acknowledged success.
He was never weary in his old age of sounding her
praises, and acknowledging how much he owed to her.
He could scarcely speak of her without the tears starting
into his eyes, while his utterances, broken through
strong emotion, could hardly discharge the fulness of
his heart. The last record that I have of my conversations
with him ends with her praises. “My mother
was,” he said, “a most admirable woman in every
respect. She had great natural intellect. She had a
willingness to exert herself for the good of her family,
and she did exert herself beyond her powers.” My
record thus ends:—“Here he became so affected that
I thought a longer talk might be hurtful to him, and so
I came away.”</p>

<p class="caption">(MOTHER OF SIR ROWLAND HILL.)</p>
</div>

<p>Her husband was no less mindful of her high merits.
“Her children arise up, and call her blessed;—her
husband also, and he praiseth her.” After her death he
more than once told his daughter that the only merit he
claimed in bringing up his family was that of letting
their mother do exactly as she liked. “It was to her
influence—an influence of the most beneficial kind—that
he attributed the merit of their becoming good and
useful members of society.” “As a theme for eloquence,”
he one day wrote to one of his sons, “you may sound
the trumpet of past success and long experience in your
<i>transcendent</i> mother.” “She was,” said her daughter,
“a large-hearted woman, taking upon herself all duties
that lay within her reach, whether properly belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to her or not.” To her great courage her son thus
bears testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many instances fell under my own observation, but the one I
mention was of earlier date. Happening to be present when, in the
midst of a violent thunderstorm, an imperious mistress ordered her
terrified maidservant to go and take down the clothes that were
hanging out to dry, my mother at once volunteered for the service,
and performed it in full, though not without imminent risk of her
life; for before she could regain the house a tree, from which she had
detached one of the lines, was struck by lightning.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p>She had been as a mere child the most dutiful of
daughters. She was the most devoted and unselfish
of wives and mothers. Yet by strangers all her merits
were not quickly seen. Her warm heart was hidden
beneath cold and reserved manners. Outsiders were
astonished at the extraordinary degree of affection
that her children felt for her. Some of this coldness
of manner, and all the hidden warmth of heart
were inherited from her by her famous son. She
had had but a small chance of getting much book-learning,
yet she took a strong interest in her husband’s
studies and pursuits. Her son said that she
possessed remarkable sagacity and no small readiness
in contrivance. It was not, however, by inventiveness
or by originality that she was distinguished. In those
qualities her husband was strong. She was strong
where he was weak. If he had every sense but
common sense, she had common sense in a high
degree. She had with it an unusual strength of
character—a strength that made itself none the less felt
because it was quiet. “We must not forget,” wrote
one of her sons to his brother, when the death of her
youngest child was looked for, and they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dreading the terrible blank that would arise, “we must
not forget that mother is not an ordinary woman—her
powers of self-control and conformity to existing circumstances
are unusually great.” She was not wanting in
honest ambition. She did not, indeed, look for any high
position for her sons. She smiled incredulously when one
of her boys told her that the day would come when she
should ride in his carriage. But she was resolved that
her children should not sink through poverty out of that
middle class into which they were born. She was most
anxious that they should have the advantages of that
education which had never fallen to her lot. It was
her doing that her husband left trade, for which he was
but ill-fitted, and started a school. In the step that he
thus took she saw the best means of getting their own
children taught. She was unwearying in her efforts to
add to her husband’s scanty income, and most rigid in
her economy. She longed to provide for him and for her
children that freedom of action which is only enjoyed
by those who have freedom from debt. Her eldest
son has thus recorded his recollections of her during
the terrible year 1800, when he was but a child of
eight years:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Well do I remember that time of dearth, and even famine. As
I was the eldest, my mother, in the absence of her husband, opened
her heart now and then to me; and I knew how she lay in
wakefulness, passing much of the night in little plans for ensuring
food and clothing to her children by the exercise of the strictest
parsimony. How she accomplished her task I know not; I cannot
imagine; but certain it was that we never wanted either wholesome food
or decent raiment, and were always looked upon by the poor of the
neighbourhood as gentlefolk. Her achievement she regarded in
after and more prosperous years with honest pride and gratulation.
Nor was she less anxious for our instruction than for our physical
comforts. She had but little reading, but possessed a quick and
lively apprehension and natural good taste. She was clever at
figures, working by mental arithmetic; not pursuing rules, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
acting on her natural sagacity. She was honourable and high-minded,
and had a great contempt for the unreal in religion, morals,
or manners; shabby gentility and dirt, especially when concealed,
excited her disapprobation. In her youth she was comely, not to say
handsome. I remember her, fair-haired and fair-complexioned. She
was the tenderest of parents.”</p>

</div>

<p>Her merits as the mistress of a household were thus
summed up by Rowland Hill. “I scarcely think there
ever was a woman out of France who could make so
much out of so little.”</p>

<p>The husband and wife each supplied in character
that in which the other was wanting. In Rowland
was seen a remarkable combination of the strong
qualities of each parent. His father, however, had a
two-fold influence on his character. Almost as much
as he nourished his intellect and one side of his moral
nature by sympathy, so he increased another side by
the strong feeling of antipathy that he unconsciously
raised. The son was shocked with his father’s want
both of method and steady persistence, with the easy
way in which he often set on one side matters that
troubled him, and with the complacency with which he
still regarded his theories, however much they were
buffeted and bruised by practice. Here Rowland set
before him his mother’s best qualities. He had,
indeed, received them in large measure from nature,
but he cultivated them from his earliest youth with
a steadiness that never fell off or wearied. He
went, perhaps, into the opposite extreme of that
which he shunned, and gained a certain rigidity
of character which at times appeared to be excessive.</p>

<p>I have seen a letter from his mother’s brother, Bailie
Lea, written years ago to one of his nieces, in which he
recalls, he says, “times, some seventy years ago, long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
before any of you were born.” He describes with some
humour how he had helped young Tom Hill in his courtship.
He adds, “The happy hour began to draw nigh,
the gown was bought, made, and fitted on; the knot
tied, the work was done, and it speaks for itself in
every quarter of the globe.” With honest and just
pride in his sister, the old man adds, “But Tom Hill
could not have accomplished the half of what appears
with any other woman for a wife than Sally Lea.”
Certainly Rowland Hill always believed that he himself
could not have accomplished the half of what he did
had he not had such a mother. I know not whether
my grandfather had any rivals. A charming story that
is told of his old age leads me to think that he must
have had at least one. His wife, when they had been
married close on fifty years, one day called him, with a
Birmingham plainness of speech, “An old fool!” A child
who was staying in the house overheard him, as he left
the room and slowly went up the stairs, muttering to
himself, “Humph! she called me an old fool—an old
fool!” Then he stopped, and was silent for a few
moments, till suddenly rubbing his hands together,
he exclaimed, “A lucky dog I was to get her,
though!” His memory had carried him back full fifty
years, before the ring was bought and the gown
made, when young Tom Hill had still to win the
heart and hand of Sarah Lea. A few years after
her death he was one day missing. Some hours
passed by, and nothing could be heard of the
aged man who numbered now his fourscore years
and four. At length he was seen trudging slowly
homewards. He had gone on foot full five miles
to his wife’s grave, and on foot he was making his
way back.</p>

<p>His marriage had been delayed for a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by the riots in which the chapels of the dissenters,
and many of their houses, were burnt to the ground
by a brutal Church-and-King mob. With several
of his companions he had hurried off to defend
the house of their revered pastor, but their services
were unhappily declined. Priestley declared that
it was the duty of a Christian minister to submit
to persecution. The rest of the story of this
eventful scene I shall tell in the words of his eldest
son:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His companions went away, perhaps to escort their good pastor
and his family, whose lives would not have been secure against the
ruffians coming to demolish their home and property. My father
barred the doors, closed the shutters, made fast the house as securely
as he could against the expected rioters, and then awaited their
arrival. He has often described to me how he walked to and fro in
the darkened rooms, chafing under the restriction which had been
put on him and his friends. He was present when the mob broke
in, and witnessed the plunder and destruction, and the incendiary fire
by which the outrage was consummated. Lingering near the house, he
saw a working man fill his apron with shoes, with which he made off.
My father followed him, and, as soon as the thief was alone, collared
him, and dragged him to the gaol, where he had the mortification
to witness the man quietly relieved of his booty, and then suffered
to depart, the keeper informing my father that he had had orders to
take in no prisoners that night! The mob, which had begun by
attacking dissenters as public enemies, burning down their chapels
and their houses, and making spoil of their goods, soon expanded their
views, and gave unmistakable signs that the distinction between dissenter
and churchman had had its hour, and was to be superseded in
favour of the doctrine now so well known, ‘La propriété, c’est un vol.’
When matters came to this pass the magistrates swore-in special constables.
My father was one of this body; and, like his comrades,
compendiously armed with half a mop-stick by way of truncheon, he
marched with them to the defence of Baskerville House, in Birmingham,
which was under attack by the mob. The special constables at
first drove all before them, in spite of the immense disparity of numbers;
but after a time, becoming separated in the <i>mêlée</i>, they sustained
a total defeat. Some were very severely bruised, and one died of the
injuries which he received in the fight. My father, although not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
conscious at the time of having received a blow, could not the next
morning raise his arm. He was always of opinion that if they had
had a flag, or some signal of that kind, round which they could have
rallied, the fortune of the day would have been reversed.”</p>

</div>

<p>The blow that he had received was at all events so
severe that his marriage had to be put off for a fortnight.
For three or four years the young couple lived at
Birmingham.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They then removed to Kidderminster,
where Rowland was born in the freehold house that
had belonged to three generations of his family.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It
was not, however, to remain long in his father’s hands.
The French war ruined the manufacture in which he
had engaged, and in the great straits to which he was
before long reduced, he was able to retain nothing of
his small inheritance. He left Kidderminster, and
removed to Wolverhampton, where he found employment.
His salary however was so small that it was
only by means of the severest thrift that he managed
to keep his head above water. It was in the stern
school of poverty that Rowland was brought up from
his earliest years. Like Garrick, he was “bred in a
family whose study was to make four pence do as much
as others made four pence half-penny do.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE BIRTH-PLACE OF SIR ROWLAND HILL, KIDDERMINSTER.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>His father had taken an old farm-house, called
Horsehills, that stood about a mile from Wolverhampton.
It had long been empty, and the rent was so low that
at first it excited his suspicions. It was not till he had
signed the lease that he was informed that the house
was haunted. He cared much about a low rent, and
nothing about ghosts. On such terms he would have
been only too glad to find a haunted house each time he
changed his place of abode. He lived here till Rowland
was seven years old. When the child had become a
man of eighty he put on record many of the memories
that he still retained of this home of his early days.
Here it was that they were living during the terrible
dearth of 1800, of which for many a year, men, he says,
could hardly talk without a shudder. He could
remember how one day during this famine when they
were dining on bread and butter and lettuce, a beggar
came to the door. His mother took from the dish one
of the slices and sent it to the man. He refused it because
there was not butter enough for him. The half-starved
people took to plundering the fields of the potatoes,
and the owners, in order to secure them, set about to
dig them up and store them. Late rains, moreover, had
followed the hot weather, and the roots had begun to
sprout. Rowland writes, “I remember that when our
crop of late potatoes was dug up, we children were set
to spread them over the floor of the only room that
could be spared. It was one of the parlours.” Likely
enough they were thus brought into the house as a safer
place against the rioters than any outhouse. Bread
riots broke out. Most of the judges declaimed on the
winter circuits against the forestallers. “A violent
clamour was excited against corn-dealers and farmers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which being joined in by the mob, artificial scarcity
became the cry. Farmers were threatened, and their
barns and ricks in many places were set on fire.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> One
band of rioters came to Horsehills, thinking no doubt
that, as it was a farm-house, the occupier was a farmer.
“The house was entered, and a demand made for bread;
but the poor fellows, hungry as they doubtless were,
listened to explanations; and upon one of them saying,
‘Oh, come away; look at the missis how bad her (she)
looks,’ they all quietly withdrew.” I have heard my
father say that so terrible had been the dearth, and so
painful were the memories it raised, that they had all
come to look upon bread as something holy. Once,
when a mere child, he had seen a play-fellow wantonly
waste a piece of bread by throwing it about. He was
seized with alarm lest some terrible judgment from
Heaven should come, not only upon the one guilty
person, but upon all who were in his company. He
feared lest the roof might fall down upon them. It may
have been during this time of famine that Rowland, for
the first time in his life, and perhaps for the last time,
wished to go into debt. He was one day telling me
how slowly and painfully he had, in his boyhood, saved
up his money in order to buy useful articles of which
he stood in need. I asked him whether he had never
been tempted by the pastrycook. “No,” he answered;
but yet, he added with a smile, according to a story
that was told of him, he once had been. He had gone,
when a very little child, to a woman who kept a stall
in Wolverhampton market-place, and had asked her
to let him have a half-penny-worth of sweets on
trust. When she refused, he then begged her to lend
him a half-penny, with which he would buy the
sweets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>One adventure in these days of his childhood impressed
itself most deeply on his memory. His father, who
had gone one day on business to a town some miles off,
was very late in returning. His mother became uneasy,
and set off quite alone to meet her husband. Soon
after she had started, he returned, but though he had
come by the way along which she had gone, he had not
met her. He in his turn was full of alarm. He sent
off his eldest boy, a lad of nine, in one direction. The
two next boys, Edwin and Rowland, who were at
most eight and six years old, he bade go by one road
to Wolverhampton, and come back by another. He
himself took a third way. The boys set out, not indeed
without fear, but nevertheless “with a conviction that
the work must be done.” The two younger lads had
first to go along a dark lane. They then came to a
spot where, underneath the cross-ways, there lay buried,
as they knew, the body of a lad who had ended his life
with his own hand. The place was known as Dead
Boy’s Grave. Next they had to pass near the brink of
a gravel pit, “to them an awful chasm, which they
shuddered by as they could.” At length they made
their round, and not far off midnight, as Rowland
believed, reached home. There to their great joy
they found the rest gathered together. The eldest
boy, who had been alone, though a lad of great
courage, had suffered not a little from fear. Neither
he, nor his father, had met the mother, who reached
home before them. As she had been going along
the lane, she had been alarmed, she said, by a man
who started up on the other side of the hedge.
In her fright she had cleared the opposite fence at
a bound, and had made her way home over the
fields. The next day her husband went with her to
the spot, but though he was an active and muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
man, he failed to make in his strength the leap
which she had made in the terror which comes from
weakness.</p>

<p>Rowland Hill was fond of talking in his old age of
his childhood, of which he retained a very clear memory.
He remembered how one day in the autumn of 1801,
his brothers came back from school with the news that
the mail coach had driven into Wolverhampton decked
with blue ribbons. Tidings had just arrived of peace
with France.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The whole country was in a blaze with
bonfires and illuminations. Rowland and his brothers,
when it grew dark, set fire to the stump of an old tree,
and so bore their part in the general rejoicings.
When war broke out again with France he was living in
Birmingham. “Old Boney,” became the terror of all
English children, as “Malbrook,” a hundred years before,
had been the terror of all French children. Within
half-a-mile of his father’s house, “the forging of gun-barrels
was almost incessant, beginning each day long
before dawn, and continuing long after nightfall; the
noise of the hammers being drowned ever and anon by
the rattle from the proof-house.” Their own house each
time felt the shock, and his mother’s brewings of beer
were injured by the constant jars. On the open ground
in front of the house, one division of the Birmingham
Volunteers was drilled each Sunday morning. Sunday
drilling, in this season of alarms, went on throughout
the length and breadth of the land. The press-gang
now and then came so far as this inland town. He
could remember the alarm they caused him and his
brothers. They were fearful not so much for themselves
as for their father.</p>

<p>One day a captured French gun-boat was dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into Birmingham, and shown at a small charge. Hitherto
he had seen no vessel bigger than a coal barge. For
the first time he saw a real anchor and ship guns. As
he returned home with his brothers, they talked over the
loss of the Royal George, and other “moving accidents
by flood.” He could “well remember the mingled joy
and grief at the great, but dearly-bought, victory of
Trafalgar.” The following verses of a rude ballad
that was sung in the streets remained fixed in his
memory:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On the nineteenth<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of October,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">A most glorious prize.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">“We fought for full four hours,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Will long bemoan their loss;</div>
<div class="verse">For he was as brave an Admiral,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As e’er the ocean crossed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other memories of his carried back those who heard
him talk in his latter years to a state of life that was
very unlike the present. The baker who supplied them
with bread kept his reckoning by tallies. Their milk-woman
had just such another score as that which was
presented to Hogarth’s Distressed Poet. A travelling
tailor used to come his rounds, and, in accordance with
the common custom, live in their house while he was
making clothes for the family. In every show of feats
of horsemanship, the performance always ended with
the burlesque of the Tailor riding to Brentford to vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for John Wilkes. Whenever any disaster came upon the
country, there were still found old people who solemnly
shook their heads, and gravely pointed it out as another
instance of the divine wrath for the great sin that the
nation had committed when it made the change of style.</p>

<p>The changes that he saw in the currency were
very great. In his early childhood, gold pieces—guineas,
half guineas, and seven shilling bits,—were not
uncommon, but they began to disappear, and before
long were scarcely ever seen. When one did come to
hand, it was called a stranger. About the year 1813, one
of his brothers sold a guinea for a one pound note and
eight shillings in silver. As the gold began to be
hoarded, these one pound notes took their place. Bank
of England notes were in Birmingham looked upon
with suspicion, for they were more often forged than
provincial notes. The silver coins of the realm were
so well worn, that hardly any of them bore even a
trace of an effigy or legend. “Any that were still unworn
were called pretty shillings and the like,” and were
suspected by the lower class of dealers as something
irregular. Together with the state currency, tokens
circulated to a great extent. There were Bank of
England tokens, of the value of five shillings, three
shillings, and one shilling and sixpence. The parish of
Birmingham had its notes for one pound, and five shillings,
and its workhouse shilling, as the coin was called.
It had been issued by the guardians as a convenient
means of distributing out-of-door relief. All these coins
and tokens were more or less forged. The coins of the
realm stood lowest in point of security, then the Bank of
England tokens; while the parish tokens were hardly
ever imitated, and were everywhere received with confidence.
Forgery was constantly carried on. One daring
and notorious forger and coiner, named Booth, long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
defied the police. His house stood in the midst of an
open plain, some miles from Birmingham, and was very
strongly barricaded. The officers had more than once
forced an entry; but so careful had been his watch, that,
by the time they had been able to break in, all proofs
of his crime had been destroyed. Rowland Hill had
seen him riding into town, on his way to the rolling-mills,
with the metal in his saddle-bags. The boy took
more than a common interest in the man, as in this very
rolling-mill one of his own brothers was employed. One
day the messenger whom Booth had sent with the
metal had forgotten to bring a pattern. “Taking out
a three-shilling piece, the man inserted it in one slit
after another of the gauge, until he found the one which
exactly corresponded with its thickness, and this he gave
as the guide.” His long freedom from punishment
rendered the coiner careless, and he was at last surprised.
The whole Birmingham police force was mustered, and
a troop of dragoons was got from the barracks. A
ladder had been brought, and an entrance was made
through the tiling of the roof. It seemed as if they
were once more too late, for at first nothing could be
found. One of the “runners,” however, in mounting
the ladder, had through the bars of an upper window
seen Booth hurriedly thrusting papers, that no doubt
were forged notes, into the fire. A hole was broken
into the chimney, and in it were found one whole note,
and one partly burnt. The prisoners were taken to
Birmingham, and thence were sent by the magistrates
to Stafford, under the guard of a small body of horse.
Booth was hanged.</p>

<p>It is scarcely wonderful that criminals openly defied
the laws, for the police-force of Birmingham was very
small. The town contained in the early years of this
century about seventy thousand inhabitants. Yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
whole police-force for day duty consisted of less than
twenty men. By night, guard was kept by the usual
body of “ancient and most quiet watchmen.” The
town, moreover, like all other towns, was but dimly
lighted with its oil-lamps. Rowland was about seventeen
years old when, “with almost unbounded delight,
I first saw,” he writes, “streets illuminated by gas.”
Yet the peace was, on the whole, not ill kept. From
1803 to 1833 there were but three riots, and of these
only one was at all serious. The town had not even in
those days a Recorder, and the criminals were sent
to the Assizes at Warwick. The stage-coaches, as
Rowland well remembered, were all furnished with
strong staples, to which the fetters of prisoners were
fast locked. He had himself, when he was still a little
lad, sat on the coach beside a man thus fettered. The
fellow made light of his position. “He had,” he said,
“only robbed a hen-roost, and they couldn’t touch his
neck for that.” Some idle gossip, seeing Rowland thus
sitting by the thief, at once spread the report that the
boy on the coach was going to Warwick on the charge
of robbing his master.</p>

<p>I have been carried away in my narrative not a little
distance from the quiet home in the neighbourhood of
Wolverhampton. The old farm-house was endeared
to Rowland Hill by one memory, for here it was that
he first met with his future wife. Her father, Mr.
Joseph Pearson, was a manufacturer of Wolverhampton.
“I regarded him throughout life,” said his son-in-law,
“with esteem and affection. He was in the town,
near to which he resided, the recognised leader of the
Liberal party, and, at a later period, when the town
became enfranchised, was the standing Chairman
of the Committee for returning the Liberal candidate.
He had always been a staunch Liberal, to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the modern term, and I doubt not was regarded by
his Tory neighbours as a Jacobin; for so all were held
who either preferred Fox to Pitt, or ventured to
question the justice or necessity of the war of 1793. I
have been told that during the course of that war he
once took part in a meeting held in the market-place
of the town to petition for peace, when cannon, brought
out in apprehension, or feigned apprehension, of a
tumult, stood pointed at the assembly.” He had once,
when a young man, during his year of office as constable
of the borough, faced a mob of colliers bent on bull-baiting.
He pulled up the stake, and put a stop for
that day to the sport. About the same time Basil
Montagu had to flee for his life from a country town,
where he, too, had spoilt sport by saving an innocent
man from the gallows. Mr. Pearson took great pleasure
in Thomas Hill’s society. In social position he was,
indeed, above him, for he was a man of considerable
property, and a magistrate for the county. In Mrs.
Hill’s rice-puddings, in the making of which she was
“a notable woman,” and in her husband’s talk, he
found, however, enough to satisfy him.</p>

<p>Rowland was but a year older than Mr. Pearson’s
eldest daughter. The beginning of his courtship he
has himself told in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Pearson’s visit led to intimacy between the families,
especially as regards the children; and as his eldest daughter had
attained the age of five, while I was no more advanced than six, the
two were naturally thrown much together, and, in fact, took the first
step towards that intimacy and affection which some twenty-five
years later were cemented by marriage. One whimsical little
passage in these earliest days I must record. Under the high road,
in the part nearest to my father’s house, ran what is in the midland
counties called a culver (that is a long low arch), placed there for the
passage of the rivulet, which turned my little water-wheel. Into
this culver my brother and I occasionally crept by way of adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and at times to hear the noise of a wagon as it rumbled slowly overhead.
Into this ‘cool grot and mossy cell’ I once led my new companion,
both of us necessarily bending almost double; and I cannot
but look back upon the proceeding as probably our earliest instance
of close association and mutual confidence. Many years later we
revisited the spot together, but found the passage completely silted
up, so as to be inaccessible to future wooers, however diminutive.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the age of three or four, Rowland was nearly
carried off by the scarlet fever. So ill he was that for
a short while his father and mother thought that
he had ceased to breathe. The attack left him weak
for some years. “I have never overcome,” he wrote
in his eighteenth year, “and most probably never
shall quite overcome, the effects of that illness. Ever
since I can remember I have suffered much from sickness.”
He had to pass many hours of every day lying
on his back. He used to beguile the time by counting.
He assisted himself, as he said, by a kind of topical
memory. “My practice was to count a certain number,
generally a hundred, with my eye fixed on one definite
place, as a panel of the door, or a pane in the
window, and afterwards, by counting-up the points, to
ascertain the total.” He here first showed that love of
calculation which so highly distinguished him in after
life. His health remained so feeble that he had passed
his seventh birthday before he was taught his letters.
Backward though he was in book-learning, he was
really a forward child. At the age of five he had made
himself a small water-wheel, rude enough no doubt.
Yet it worked with briskness in a little stream near his
father’s house. A water-wheel had always a great
charm for him. He had been taken to see one before
he was three years old, and he used to cry to be taken
to see it again. When he was an old man he would go
miles out of his way to see one at work. The year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
after he made his wheel, when he was now six, he and
his brother Edwin, a boy of eight, built themselves a
small model-forge of brick and mortar. The wheel
was about two feet and a-half across, and was pretty
fairly shaped. It was turned by a stream from the
spout of the pump. The axle, which they made out of
the stem of a cherry-tree, cost them a good deal of
trouble:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We attempted to connect our machinery by means of a crank
with the handle of the pump, expecting that if we once gave it a start
the water would turn the wheel, while this would not only work the
forge, but also maintain, by its operation on the pump, the stream
necessary to its own movement. In short, we looked for a perpetual
motion, and were greatly disappointed to find motion at an end as
soon as our own hands were withdrawn from the pump. When we
mentioned our perplexity to my father, after informing us that our
attempt was hopeless, and giving us such explanation as we could
understand, he consoled us under our discomfiture by telling us that
many persons, much older and wiser than ourselves, had expended
time, labour, and money, in the same fruitless quest.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A few years after this his father himself came across
one of these dreamers. He was taken by a friend to
see a machine for producing perpetual motion. The
inventor boasted of his success. “<i>There</i>,” he said,
“the machine is.” “Does it go?” the visitor asked.
“No, it does not go, but I will defy all the world to
show <i>why</i> it does not go.”</p>

<p>The lads happily had a fair supply of tools. Their
father, in his boyhood, had been fond of using them,
and had kept some of them so carefully that they were
quite serviceable for his sons. In three old looms that
had belonged to their grandfather they found an
abundant supply of materials.</p>

<p>Their life at Horsehills, if somewhat hard, was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
from being unhappy. A few years after they had left
the neighbourhood, Rowland and his elder brothers
passed through Wolverhampton on the top of a stagecoach.
At a certain point of the road the three boys
stood up in order to get a glimpse of their old home.
A gentleman seated by them, on learning what they
were gazing at, said, “to our no small gratification,”
as Rowland remembered, “that we must have been
good lads when we lived there, since we were so fond
of the place.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>When Rowland Hill was seven years old a great
change took place in the family life. His mother had
always thought very highly of her husband’s powers
and learning. She knew that he was fit for some
higher kind of work than any he had hitherto done.
She longed, moreover, to procure for her children a
better education than any that then seemed likely to be
within their reach. One of their friends, Mr. Thomas
Clark, kept a school in Birmingham, of which he was
willing to dispose. He also had been a member of Dr.
Priestley’s congregation, and in the midst of the riots had
shown great courage. “Church and King” had been
the cry of the mob, and “Church and King” chalked
on the house-door was no small safeguard against its
fury. Some friendly hand had written these words on
the door of the schoolmaster’s house. As soon as he
saw them he at once rubbed them out. With this
brave and upright man Thomas Hill became in later
years closely connected by marriage. His elder
daughter married one of Mr. Clark’s sons. Mrs. Hill
persuaded her husband to give up his business in
Wolverhampton, and to buy the school. They removed
it to a convenient house called Hill Top, on the outskirts
of Birmingham. Here Rowland passed the next
sixteen years of his life. Here—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt,</div>
<div class="verse">A virtuous household, though exceeding poor!</div>
<div class="verse">Pure livers were they all, austere and grave.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The purchase-money must have been paid off by
instalments. I have before me, as I write, a card of
the terms. The charges were moderate. Day-scholars
paid four guineas or five pounds a year, and boarders
twenty guineas or twenty-five guineas, according to
age. The address that the new schoolmaster published
is somewhat curious. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">ADDRESS.</p>

<p>“T. Hill, sensible of the severe responsibility attached to the office
of a public preceptor, resolves, if entrusted with that charge, to
devote himself to the duties of it with assiduity, perseverance, and
concentrated attention, as indispensable to reputation and success.
To ensure the co-operation of his pupils, he will make it his study to
excite their reasoning powers, and to induce in them habits of
voluntary application; for this purpose, varying the ordinary course
of instruction, and, as occasion shall offer, drawing their attention to
subjects more particularly fitted to interest their feelings; he will
always endeavour, by kindness and patience, firmness and impartiality
to secure for himself their affection and esteem. And as he aspires
to exhibit models of education, possessing higher excellencies than
mechanical dexterity or mere intellectual acuteness; his anxious aim
will be to make instruction in art and science, the culture of the
understanding, and of the physical powers, subservient to the nobler
intention of fostering and maturing the virtues of the heart.”</p>

</div>

<p>Rowland was at once placed in the school, and thus
at the age of seven his formal education began. His
health still continued weak, and his studies were too often
broken in upon by illness. He was fortunate enough,
however, to find at his new home, in an outbuilding, a
workshop, fitted with benches, a vice, and a blacksmith’s
forge. “Here,” he said, “we spent much of
our spare time, and most of our spare cash, which latter,
however, was but very scanty.” The want of pence,
indeed, often troubled him full sore. “Ever since I
can remember,” as he wrote in a Journal which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
began to keep in his eighteenth year, “I have had a
taste for mechanics.... In works of the fingers
I chiefly excel.” But the best mechanician wants
materials, and materials cost money. One Good
Friday morning he and his brother Matthew turned
dealers. They had been sent with a basket to buy hot
cross buns for the household. As they went along, the
street-vendors were calling out, after the Birmingham
fashion—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hot cross buns! Hot cross buns!</div>
<div class="verse">One a penny, two a penny, hot cross buns!</div>
<div class="verse">Sugar ’em, and butter ’em, and clap ’em in your muns.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The two lads, as they came home, began in jest to
repeat the cry. Matthew was an admirable mimic, and
had caught it exactly. To their surprise they found
themselves beset with purchasers. “Not having face
enough to reject demands which we had provoked,
perhaps not unwilling to carry on the jest, we soon
emptied our basket, and had to return for more,
deeming ourselves, however, well recompensed for the
additional trouble by the profits arising from the difference
between the wholesale price, at which we had
been allowed to purchase, and the retail price at which
we had sold.” The elder of these two lads the town,
as years went on, received as its Recorder; to the
younger it raised a statue in his life-time.</p>

<p>This was not the first time that Rowland had turned
dealer. Not long after his family had moved to Hill
Top his mother gave him a little plot of land for his
garden. It was covered with a crop of hoarhound.
This he was going to clear away to make room for his
flowers, but he was told that it had a money value.
“I cut it properly, tied it up in bundles, and, borrowing
a basket of my mother, set off one morning on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
market-day—Thursday, as I remember—with my
younger brother Arthur as my sole companion, for the
market-place of the town; and, taking my stand like
any other caterer, soon disposed of my wares, receiving
eightpence in return. Fortunately I was saved the
tediousness of retail dealing, the contents of my basket
being purchased in the gross by a woman who had
taken her stand near, and who, I hope, cleared a
hundred per cent. by the transaction, though she disparaged
her bargain by warning me to tell my mother,
‘She must tie up bigger bunches next time.’”</p>

<p>By the age of nine he had saved half-a-guinea,
which he laid out on a box of colours. His first great
purchase, however, was, as he told me, the volumes
of Miss Edgeworth’s “Parent’s Assistant.” These
cost him fifteen shillings. “Hers was a name which
he could never mention but with gratitude and respect.”
I once asked him what were the books that had
chiefly formed his character. He answered that he
thought he owed most to Miss Edgeworth’s stories.
He read them first when he was about eight or nine
years old, and he read them a great many times. He
said, and the tears came into his eyes as he spoke, that
he had resolved in these early days to be like the
characters in her stories, and to do something for the
world. “I had always had,” he said to me at another
time, “a very strong desire to do something to make
myself remembered.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“While yet a child, and long before his time,</div>
<div class="verse">Had he perceived the presence and the power</div>
<div class="verse">Of greatness.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Most of his spare money was laid out, however, in
the purchase of tools and materials. With such old
wood as they could lay hands on, and such new wood
as they could afford to buy, he and his brothers set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
about building a flat-bottomed boat in which they
meant to sail through the Birmingham and Worcester
Canal into the Severn, and up the Severn to their
uncle at Shrewsbury. They had no more misgivings
about their scheme than Robinson Crusoe had about
his escape from his island in his canoe. Yet there
was certainly one great bar to their plan, of which,
however, they knew nothing. The canal, at this
time, had not been carried half-way to the Severn.
They finished their boat, and, though it was found
to be too frail for the canal, nevertheless it carried the
bold voyagers across a horse-pond.</p>

<p>In the occupations of the workshop, and even in his
regular education, Rowland suffered interruption, not
only from frequent attacks of illness, but also from the
need that his father was under of employing his
children part of each day in household work. He
could not afford to keep many servants. While
Rowland all his life regretted that he had been taken
away from school at an early age, yet the hours that
he had passed in the discharge of domestic duties he
never looked upon as time misspent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was called upon at a very early age to perform many offices
which, in richer families, are discharged exclusively by servants—to
go on errands, to help in cleaning, arranging, and even repairing, and,
in short, to do any sort of work that lay within my power. By this
means I gradually acquired, as will hereafter better appear, a feeling
of responsibility, and habits of business, dispatch, punctuality, and
independence, which have proved invaluable to me through life.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He might well have taken to himself the words of
Ferdinand, and said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“Some kinds of baseness</div>
<div class="verse">Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters</div>
<div class="verse">Point to rich ends.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>No man, indeed, ever felt more deeply than he did
the vast importance of that great part of education,
which no examinations can test, and which many
examiners and framers of schemes of public competition
seem to treat with utter contempt.</p>

<p>The feeling of responsibility which he speaks of
did not seem to those who knew him as a child to
have been, as he himself says, gradually acquired. It
grew, no doubt, with exercise, but it was a part of his
inbred worth. “From a very early age,” says one of
his brothers, “he felt responsibility in a way none of
the others of us did. If anything went wrong it was
he who felt it.” He had inherited little of his father’s
“buoyant optimism,” and none of his contentedness
when things were going wrong. From a very early
age his mother began to share with him the troubles
that well-nigh weighed her down. They had
only grown by her husband’s change of occupation.
Matters grew worse and worse as the French War
went on. “Never surely yet,” wrote her husband,
“was a time when debts were collected with more
difficulty, or left uncollected with more danger.” She
tried more than one plan to add to the earnings of
the family, and every plan she used to talk over with
Rowland when he was still a mere child. At times she
was terribly straightened. Her brother-in-law, Williams,
“a tradesman and a scholar,” as her husband described
him, once sent them in their distress a present of five
pounds. “The sight of it,” wrote my grandfather, in
a letter which I have before me, “produced in both of
us mingled emotions of pleasure and pain. Pleasure
as a strong, too strong, testimonial of your regard and
affection, and pain as it could not but remind us of the
toils and privations which you are undergoing to
enable you to be generous as well as just. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
powerful was the latter impression that our first
impulse would have urged us to beg leave to return
this too serious mark of affection, adopting the
‘burning words’ of David, ‘Shall we drink the blood
of these men?’ but cooler consideration led to the
fear that such a measure would give more pain to you
than relief to ourselves.”</p>

<p>Others of their friends were ready to help them.
One of them, in the hearing of one of her children,
said to her, “Now, Mrs. Hill, remember you are
never to be in want of money to go to market with.”
A strong feeling of independence led her, however, to
rely on herself, on her husband, and her children. She
had a hatred of debt, and in this hatred every one of
her children came to share. “I early saw,” said
Rowland, “the terrible inconvenience of being poor.
My mother used to talk to me more than to all the
others together of our difficulties, and they were very
grievous. She used to burst into tears as she talked
about them. One day she told me that she had not a
shilling in the house, and she was afraid lest the
postman might bring a letter while she had no money
to pay the postage. She had always been careful to
save the rags, which she kept in two bags—one for the
white, and the other for the coloured. The white
were worth three or four times more than the coloured.
It occurred to her that she might sell them, though
the bags were not full. I was always sent by her on
such errands, and I got this time about three shillings
for the rags.”</p>

<p>She persuaded her husband to buy a ruling-machine,
which she and Rowland chiefly worked. “That
business is not at present well performed by anybody
in Birmingham, and so it would be a likely thing for
some of the lads to work at,” the father wrote to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
brother-in-law. She turned the handle, while her
little son, a child of nine, fed the machine. “It interfered
largely with my education,” he said. In time he
learnt to make the brass pens that were used in ruling,
and so earned a little money for himself. They next
took to making the copy-books, at first with the help
of a bookbinder. But the help of this man the boy
before long showed was not needed. “I soon
acquired, in its simpler forms, the art of bookbinding—an
art which I find I have not yet quite lost, having
lately, in my seventy-first year, made up a scrap-book
in what is called half-binding for the use of my grandchildren.”
Johnson also had learnt in his youth how
to bind a book, neither did he in advanced life forget
the art. “It were better,” wrote Mrs. Thrale to him,
“to bind books again, as you did one year in our
thatched summer-house, than weigh out doses of
mercury and opium which are not wanted.” There
were other plans which Mrs. Hill formed, and
carried out with unwearying industry, and in all
of these her little son was always ready to take his
share.</p>

<p>At the age of eleven his education was still more
broken in upon, for he was called upon to assist his
father and his elder brothers in teaching. “Young
and inexperienced as I was,” he wrote, “I had
inferiors both in age and knowledge; some of the
pupils not being more than six or seven years old.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
At the age of twelve his school education came almost
entirely to an end. He was, it is true, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
longer enrolled among the boys, and he still received
some instruction. But henceforth he was much more
a teacher than a pupil. One day in every week, for a
few years of his boyhood, his employment lay
altogether outside school-work. His second brother,
Edwin, had been engaged every Wednesday in the
Assay Office. But he got a better appointment.
“Rowland,” wrote his father, “succeeds Edwin at
the Assay Office. So that you see preferment goes
on among us, and I will answer we think ourselves as
happy on such occasions as our virtuous Governors
fancy themselves, even in their sinecures, which our
posts certainly cannot be called.”</p>

<p>The best part of his education he got from his
father, not in class-hours, but in the daily intercourse
of their home life. This went on for many a year
after he left off receiving from him regular instruction.
“His children were,” Rowland wrote, “though in an
irregular and desultory manner, his private pupils, and
as a private teacher he was very successful.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1807 his father gave a series of lectures
on electricity, mechanics, astronomy, pneumatics, and
the gases.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These lectures, to which I paid a fixed attention, gave me a new
impulse. I resolved to make an electrical machine for myself, and
speedily went to work. The cylinder (plate-glass machines were yet
unknown) I got blown at a glass-house in the town, paying for it the
sum of sixteen shillings. Of course, to a child, there was much
difficulty at almost every step, but my hardest task was to make a
pattern for the caps. My first attempt was sufficiently primitive, viz.,
to cut one out from a large turnip. Not succeeding in this, I resorted
to casting. Lead was the metal I naturally chose, as most easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
melted; and having, after many attempts, at length succeeded in
bringing my sand into due shape, I emptied my ladle into the mould
and brought out my pattern cap, which, when duly smoothened in
the lathe of a friendly workman in the neighbourhood, I bore, with
no small pride and satisfaction, to the founder’s, that it might be cast
in brass. One serious difficulty in construction I avoided by carrying
the axle, which was a strong iron rod, right through the cylinder,
instead of attempting to break it off, as usual, just within the caps.
The prime conductor, too, I did not attempt to make hollow, but
satisfied myself with bringing a piece of wood into the proper
cylindrical shape, and then covering it over, first with paper, and
afterwards with tinfoil.</p>

<p>“While the work was in progress I was attacked with illness, and
for a time was confined to the house. It was during this period that
the new caps, in all their first brightness, arrived from the brass-founder’s;
and as soon as I was a little better I was of course eager
to attach them to the cylinder; but the workshop being too cold for
an invalid, my patience would have been sorely tried had not my
indulgent mother made provision for me in the parlour, by substituting
for the hearthrug an old carpet folded in several doubles,
so as to prevent the droppings from my ladle from injuring
the somewhat better carpet on the floor; and here, the cement
being melted over a good fire, the cylinder was duly prepared for
mounting.</p>

<p>“My simple apparatus was completed in about a year and a-half.
I set it to work with no small trepidation, having heard much about
the uncertainty of electrical action, and fearing lest my limited means
and powers might have left some fatal defect. So great was my
uncertainty, that even after giving the machine three or four turns, I
still hesitated to apply the decisive test, and great indeed were my
pride and joy when my knuckle drew from the conductor its first
spark.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Downstairs I rushed in quest of sympathy, nor could I be
satisfied until my father and many others had witnessed the performance
with admiring eyes. A few years afterwards I added some
improvements, substituting for the deal frame one of mahogany,
procuring a hollow conductor from the tinman’s, made of course
according to my own directions, and giving also greater neatness and
efficiency to the subordinate parts of the machine and its various
adjuncts; and I may add the apparatus, though in a somewhat
imperfect state, is still extant. Meanwhile, however, a friend of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
father’s, the late Mr. Michael Beasley, a schoolmaster of Stourbridge,
who through life showed great affection for me, and to whom I owe
much in various ways, having seen the machine in its first simple
state, engaged me to make a duplicate for himself, though on a
smaller scale. This I accomplished in about six months; and while
my outlay amounted to two pounds, I received in payment, for
materials and workmanship, the sum of three guineas, which I considered
a handsome remuneration, though I have now no doubt that
my kind friend would have given me yet more had his means been
less restricted.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was from his father, that his son got his strong
love for astronomy, and acquired, as he said, even
while a boy, no inconsiderable knowledge of the
subject. A few years before his death, he drew up an
interesting paper on his astronomical studies.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In it he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My father (like myself in youth and early manhood) was a great
walker, and we frequently journeyed together. When I was only nine
years of age I walked with him, for the most part after dark, from
Birmingham to Stourbridge, a distance of twelve miles—with occasional
lifts no doubt—according to usage—on his back. I recollect
that it was a brilliant starlight night, and the names of the constellations,
and of the brighter single stars, their apparent motions, and
the distinction between the so-called fixed stars and planets, formed
then, as on many similar occasions, never-failing subjects of interesting
conversation, and to me of instruction. On the way we passed by the
side of a small pool, and the air being still, the surface of the water
gave a perfect reflection of the stars. I have a vivid recollection,
after an interval of nearly seventy years, of the fear with which I
looked into what appeared to me a vast abyss, and of my clinging to
my father, to protect me from falling into it.”</p>

</div>

<p>His father had a reflecting telescope that showed
Jupiter’s moons and Saturn’s rings, a Hadley’s quadrant,
an artificial horizon, and a tolerably good clock. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
took in, moreover, the “Nautical Almanac.” “By means
of this simple apparatus,” wrote his son, “he not only
regulated the clock, but determined the latitude, and
even the longitude of our house, or rather of the
playground. In these occupations I was always his
assistant.” No sooner had Rowland learnt anything
than he set about teaching it. In fact, as he himself
stated, learning and teaching with him generally
went on hand in hand. He gave lectures on astronomy
to the boys of the school, and later on to a Literary
and Scientific Association, of which he was one of the
founders. “With a view to these lectures, I read all
the contributions of Sir William Herschel to the transactions
of the Royal Society. My reverence for the
man led me to contrive, on the occasion of my second
visit to London, to go round by Slough, in order that
I might obtain a glimpse—as the coach passed—of his
great telescope, which I knew could be seen over the
tops of the neighbouring buildings.” Astronomy was,
indeed, as he always said, his favourite science. At an
early date he became a member of the Royal Astronomical
Society. He kept up his interest in its proceedings
till the close of his life. When he had passed
the age of threescore years and ten, he discovered
some important errors in the Address of one of the
Presidents.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>All through life, whatever he read he read with
an acuteness, a patience, and an earnest desire to
arrive at the truth, that would have done honour to a
judge.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When a boy, I was fond of reading books of elementary science.
I occasionally met with statements which puzzled me—which appeared
to me to be wrong; but assuming, as children do, the infallibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the author—or perhaps I should say of a printed book—I naturally
came to the conclusion that my own understanding was in fault, and
became greatly disheartened. After awhile—I forget on what
occasion—I applied for a solution of the puzzle to my father, who,
possessing a large amount of general information, was well qualified
to advise. To my great delight, he assured me that I was right and the
author wrong. My unqualified faith in printed statements was now of
course at an end; and a habit was gradually formed of mentally
criticising almost everything I read—a habit which, however useful
in early life, is, as I have found in old age, a cause of much waste
of thinking power when the amount is so reduced as to render economy
of essential importance. Still, through the greater part of my life,
this habit of reading critically, combined as it was with the power of
rapid calculation, has been of great use to me, especially in my contests
with the Post Office, and, after I had joined the Department, in the
revision of the thousands of Reports, Returns, and Minutes prepared
by other officers.”</p>

</div>

<p>How deep were some of the problems which in his
youth he tried to fathom is shown by the following
extract from his paper on Astronomy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some sixty years ago, my attention having been accidentally drawn
to a tide-mill for grinding corn, I began to consider what was the
source of the power employed, and came to the conclusion that it was
the momentum of the Earth’s revolution on its axis. The next question
I asked myself was—could such power be diverted—in however
slight a degree—without drawing, as it were, on the stock? Further
consideration showed me that the draught required for grinding the
corn was trifling in comparison with that employed in grinding the
pebbles on every seashore upon the Earth’s surface; and consequently
that the drain on the Earth’s momentum might suffice in the course
of ages to effect an appreciable retardation in the Earth’s diurnal
revolution.</p>

<p>“I now, as usual in case of difficulty, applied to my father. He
could detect no fault in my reasoning, but informed me that Laplace
had demonstrated in his great work (”<i>La Mécanique Céleste</i>“) that the
time occupied in the Earth’s diurnal revolution is absolutely invariable.
Of course both my father and I accepted the authority as unquestionable;
but I never could fully satisfy my mind on the subject, and
for the greater part of my life it was a standing puzzle.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Many were the lines of thought that Thomas Hill
opened out before his children. “At an early age,”
said his son, “we were all fond of reading, had a strong
desire for knowledge, and became studious, assisting
one another, and obtaining, when required, effectual
help from my father.” Though he was ready enough
to help his children, yet he did not himself set them to
study. “I had an excellent understanding for mathematics,”
his son said, “and my father had a great liking
for them, with a fair knowledge of them, yet he did not
teach me them.” That is to say, he did not teach them
formally and by book. When he was out walking he
would work out problems in geometry for his sons, now
and then stopping to describe figures with his walking-stick
on the dust of the road. It was not till Rowland
Hill was twenty-five years old, that he went through
Euclid. He had, indeed, some slight acquaintance
with the three first books, but even these he knew very
imperfectly. One Christmas holidays he gave up all
his spare time to Euclid, and made himself master of
the whole of it before school opened. Yet five years
earlier than this I find the following record in his
Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is frequently the case that when walking by myself I make
calculations, or invent demonstrations of rules in Mensuration or
Trigonometry to beguile away the time, and I find nothing else so
effectual. I lately made a calculation in my mind, to determine the
distance of a fixed star, supposing its annual parallax to be one second;
and, for the sake of round numbers, I took the diameter of the Earth’s
orbit at two hundred millions of miles. I forget what was the result
of the calculation, but I know that it was many billions of miles.
Some time ago, as I was walking to Smethwick, I was making some
calculations respecting the capacity of the boiler of a steam-engine,
which it was my intention to make, and for some reason or other I
wished to find the diagonal of a cube of certain dimensions. Never
having seen any rule to accomplish this, I set about to find one;
which I soon did.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Earlier even than this, when he was but seventeen,
his friend Mr. Beasley, the Stourbridge schoolmaster,
asked him to give lessons in Navigation to a young
midshipman, who had come to live with him as his
pupil.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though I had never yet opened a book on Navigation in my life,
I unhesitatingly undertook the task. Probably, in preparing my
lessons I had some assistance from my father; but one way or
other, I discharged the duty to the satisfaction, I believe, of all
concerned, teaching my pupil not merely what might be learnt from
books, but also the practical art of Navigation, so far as this could be
done on land, so that he became able, by actual observation, to find
latitude, longitude, and local time, the second being a matter of
some difficulty. This, however, was a serious addition to my work,
Mr. Beasley’s school being twelve miles distant, and my weekly
journey thither and back being always performed on foot, with a
Hadley’s quadrant to carry each time to and fro, though even when
so encumbered I was in those days a very brisk walker. I must
add that, at the time when this extra labour came upon me, my
ordinary hours in school were nine and a-half per diem, in addition
to which I, in common with my father and eldest brother, Matthew,
had many lessons to give elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A year later, his Journal shows that he began a new
study. He had become by this time an accomplished
draughtsman, and he thought perhaps to turn his
powers to good account. “I this day,” he writes,
“began to study Architecture. I can hardly say as
yet how I shall like it. I am rather afraid that there
is too much to be remembered for me, as I have but a
poor memory.” He learnt enough of the Art to enable
him, a few years later on, to be the sole architect of
his new school-house.</p>

<p>His mind would at this time have puzzled an examiner—his
knowledge and his ignorance were so strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mixed. “One cause,” he said, “of our backwardness
in school learning no doubt was that my father, who
was proud of us, never informed us of our great deficiencies.
Perhaps he was not aware of them, for though
very backward we were, I think, in advance of our
schoolfellows, who in those early days were drawn
almost exclusively from the lower grade of the middle
class.” In a passage that I have already quoted, Rowland
Hill stated that he owed much in many ways to Mr.
Beasley. He it was who first let him know how much
there is to learn. He was, indeed, both in parts and
in knowledge, far below his brother schoolmaster,
Thomas Hill; yet in many ways he was a better teacher.
He formed a high opinion of the lad, and as he grew
older, used to be fond of talking of “my young friend
Rowland Hill,” and of the great things he was to do.
He would often take him to the small inn at Hagley,
and give him tea. There he would at times hold forth
in praise of his powers to the admiration of the small
company. When the first Arctic expedition was on the
point of starting, he one day said to them, in all gravity,
“If the Government really wants to succeed, they will
send my young friend Rowland Hill.” At this time
his young friend certainly was no longer a boy. As
the old man told this story of his early days, he
laughed very heartily. Indeed, he had been just
as much amused, he said, when he first heard himself
thus praised. Nevertheless, extravagant though
his good friend’s estimate of him had always
been, yet it had done him good, as it had roused
his ambition, and had not satisfied and soothed his
vanity.</p>

<p>This worthy man, after a life of no small benevolence
and usefulness, unhappily went out of his mind. A very
harmless vanity that grew upon him was the first sign he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gave that his reason was failing. In one of his letters to
Rowland Hill, which chance has preserved, he says, “No
book need be written in these times, unless it be of an
original kind, and very perfect in its construction. But
now my vanity urges me to say that my books <i>are</i> of
the <i>original</i> character. Who ever published a Dictation
Book before me?” The next sign that he gave of his
eccentricity—and a very strong sign it was in those
days—was leaving off shaving. The following story I
tell as his “young friend” told it me. “One morning
Mr. Beasley’s son came in late for breakfast. The
father, who was very formal in his talk, said to him,
‘Well, Mr. Thomas, what piece of utility have you done
this morning? <i>I</i> have wheeled three barrows of muck
from the pig-yard into the field.’ His son replied, ‘I,
Sir, have shaved my chin this morning, and that’s the
utility I have performed.’ His father slowly rose, and
stumping out of the room (he was a fat man) exclaimed,
‘What! violate the laws of God and man, and call that
utility!” However, as has been shown, he had
rendered his young friend one great service, which
by him was never forgotten.</p>

<p>Still more did Rowland Hill learn how little he had
already learnt, when his eldest brother and he began to
give lessons in a neighbouring school. “We went,”
he said, “to teach mensuration and the lower branches
of mathematics. I went as my brother Matthew’s
assistant. The boys were immoral, and, so far as
conduct went, were very far behind our boys. But
Matthew soon became aware that in instruction, especially
in Latin, they were far in advance of ours. This
led him to investigate the causes of this superiority.
He at once began to take into his own hands the
teaching of Latin in our own school.” The two lads
had to go a distance of five miles to give these lessons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and Matthew at this time was not strong enough to
stand the double walk.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the first time in our household history, a horse had to be
bought. We had hitherto never dreamt of travelling by any other
means than the feet. My father and I undertook the purchase.
We had been informed that a certain butcher had a horse on sale.
We went to his house, looked as wise as we could, and being
informed that the price was twelve pounds, ventured, with some
trepidation, to bid eleven. This was refused: the butcher declaring
that he did not at all want to part with his horse, and that ‘his
missis’ had been scolding him for thinking of such a thing. My
father was no more fitted for bargain-making than was the Vicar of
Wakefield, and we agreed to pay the full sum. The butcher clinched
the matter, as soon as the terms were settled, by taking down a leg
of mutton and offering to give it us if we would release him from his
bargain. With this offer we were of course too cunning to close. I
need not add that the beast was a sorry jade. When it made its
first appearance at Mr. ——’s school, the pupils tauntingly inquired
which cost most, the horse or the saddle, which was new. I used to
ride behind my brother till we were near the house, when I got down
and walked. In the end we resold the horse in the horse-fair for
five pounds.”</p>

</div>

<p>Most of all was Rowland Hill indebted for that first
of all knowledge, the knowledge of self, to an eminent
physician, Dr. Johnstone, who had engaged him to give
lessons to his sons. It was at his table, he said, that it
was first brought home to him with full force how little
he as yet knew. “I heard matters talked of which I
could not in the least understand. This discovery of
my ignorance was at first very painful to me, and set
me to work very hard—too hard, in fact, for my
health.” He thus touchingly describes in his Journal
his state of mind. He was twenty-four years old
when he made this entry:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one regret that will force itself upon my mind whenever
I am led to contemplate the effects of the improvements which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from time to time been made in the proceedings of the school. I
cannot help examining my own education, and contrasting what it
unfortunately is with what it might have been had I been placed
under the influence of such a system. Except my own, I am unacquainted
with any language, whereas my youngest brother Howard,
who has been educated, I may almost say, by myself—for it has been
almost entirely according to my own plans—is familiar with Latin
and French, and has made considerable progress in Greek, and this
without neglecting anything else. When I left school—that is, when
I became a teacher—I had for about two years held undisputed
the first place in the school. It is fair, then, to suppose that I
should occupy the same place under any system of procedure—that
if I were a boy in the school at this moment, I should be at the head
of the school. Compare, then, the acquirements of the boy who
now stands in the first place in the school, with mine at his age, and
oh, what a difference will be found! When I left school I was a
proficient in no single thing. I could not write fit to be seen; I
understood but very little of arithmetic; and was not master even of
the paltry art of spelling. Of the classics and of the higher branches
of the mathematics I was altogether ignorant. I believe drawing was
the only thing I understood even tolerably. Every attainment I am
now master of—and, God knows, they are but few!—I have acquired
since I became a teacher, and for the most part by myself. Fortunately
I have, in a tolerably high degree, the faculty of invention
(and here I ought to consider that this may be in a great measure
the effect of education, and if I have acquired this only, much has
been done for me). Many a time have I given lessons, both at
home and abroad, on subjects which I began to study with my
pupils. Frequently have I solved a problem of which I never had
heard till asked by my pupil to explain it to him. I remember well
that the first time I ever saw the inside of a work on mensuration
was when asked by a young gentleman at a school where I assisted
Matthew in giving lessons, to explain to him one of the most
difficult problems in the book: it is to find the area of a zone—a
problem which involves many minor ones. Many of these I had
before invented for myself, ignorant of the existence of any work on
the subject. I was able to give the young man the assistance he
required, and with so little hesitation that I believe he did not
suspect my ignorance.</p>

<p>“Circumstances similar to this have forced me into an acquaintance
with many subjects, and I may truly say that almost all I know
has been acquired in teaching others. For from the circumstance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
my having, till within the last few years, found among those with
whom I associated, few who were my equals, and scarcely any who
were my superiors, I thought that, except my father and one or
two other individuals, there were none whose acquirements would
entitle them to a rank higher than my own. I was, therefore,
satisfied with the progress I had made. But what was my disappointment
when the increasing character of the school and other
circumstances opened my way into a class of society among whom I
found it was taken for granted that a man should be acquainted
with Latin, and Greek, and French—languages of which I was profoundly
ignorant, and the knowledge of which I foolishly thought
was confined to a few. No one knows the pain which I have
frequently felt when, in a company where I was but slightly known,
the conversation has turned upon literary subjects, lest it should be
discovered that I was unacquainted with that which no one seemed
to take credit to himself for knowing, and to be ignorant of which
appeared, therefore, to be so much the more disgraceful. With
what shame have I sometimes declared my ignorance, rather than
appear to understand that which I did not! What would I not give
to become young again, and enter the school in its present state! I
do not blame my father; he has been an excellent parent to us all.
The difficulties he had to contend with in early life were such as to
leave him but little time to attend to the education of his children.
His whole efforts, together with my mother’s, were necessary to
enable him to maintain us; and notwithstanding his talents are so
great, he certainly is not acquainted with the modes of influencing
others. System is what he likes as little as he understands. We
cannot blame him for this; we may with as much justice blame a
man because he is not six feet high. And I have often thought that
the education which he gave us was more favourable to originality
than if we had made great acquirements. Perhaps if I had been a
good classical scholar I never should have invented the system of
operating upon others which I have arranged. It is impossible to
say how it would have been. I have often asked myself the
question, Is it now too late to educate myself? I am afraid it is
too late to do much. Ever since I was a child I have worked very
hard; my time has always been very closely occupied in gaining a
livelihood; and I now begin to feel the effects of so laborious a life.
My memory is less tenacious than it was; and I find great difficulty
in beginning a study to which I am not accustomed. Besides, my
time is so fully occupied in attending to the school, and to the great
mass of private teaching on which I am engaged (altogether seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
amounting to less than thirteen hours per day, even subtracting
meal-times), that I feel I cannot work any harder. My mind almost
always feels wearied. If I rise earlier than usual in the morning, I
am no gainer, for I fall to sleep in the middle of the day; so that
the only alternative left me is, either to be satisfied with the little
time I can now devote to my own improvement, or give up some of
my engagements, and thus lessen our income, which is not at all
superfluous. What to do I know not; and the dissatisfied, uncertain
state of mind in which I now am makes me sometimes very
miserable, and I am afraid materially injures my health. Here I
ought to say that my kind parents have frequently expressed their
wish that I should not labour so hard as I do, but I am constantly
in hopes that by so doing I may secure future ease.”</p>

</div>

<p>The ease that he desired to secure was only that
“independence, that first earthly blessing,” to use
Gibbon’s words, which a man may enjoy to the full, and
yet scorn delights and live laborious days, while he
freely indulges the last infirmity of noble mind, and
pursues with unrestrained course some lofty object of
ambition. “So inviting are the distant prospects of
ambition,” Rowland Hill wrote in his Journal only a
year later, “and such is my anxiety to correct the defects
of my education, that I feel it difficult to resist the
temptation of sacrificing physical to mental health—future
strength to future fame.... I am convinced
of the necessity of making very vigorous improvements
in my own mind. I hope I have already done much,
and I am determined to accomplish more.” In some
of his letters that have been preserved, I see that more
than once he turned his mind towards Cambridge.
Even at the age of seven-and-twenty he had not given
up all hope of getting for himself a University education.
He asked his eldest brother to ascertain the cost. On
hearing from him in answer, he wrote, “I do not know
how to decide respecting Cambridge. I am disappointed
at finding the thing so terribly expensive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In more than one Literary and Scientific Society that
he helped to found, he had long laboured hard to train
his mind and increase his knowledge. He and his
brothers, as he told me when he gave me an account
of the foundation of the first of these small societies,
were becoming aware of their great deficiencies in
education. To cure these, some of them formed a
Mutual Improvement Society. It never numbered
more than five members. Their father gave them the
use of a comfortable summer-house that was in the
garden at Hill Top. Here they met early every
Sunday morning, and set each other tasks for the
coming week. They then read through, and talked
over the tasks of the last week. He said, with a smile,
that he could well remember strongly supporting in the
summer-house the abolition of the National Debt, by
the simple means of not paying it. They bought the
quarto edition of Johnson’s Dictionary, and took in the
“Edinburgh Review.” They paid for their own coal,
and for their breakfast, which they always cooked with
their own hands. “We never thought of coming upon
our father for anything. We enjoyed the meal the most
in the week.” From his Journal I find that it was in the
year 1816 that this society was founded, and that its
object was “the improvement of our literary knowledge.”</p>

<p>In the following year the members, while still
keeping up their Sunday morning meetings, formed a
second society for literary and scientific discussion.
They met each Thursday evening in the summer-house.
In course of time these two societies came to an end.
But in 1819 a third society was formed. I extract the
following entries from his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>December 17th, 1819.</i>—This evening I read a lecture on the
history of Astronomy before a society of young men which has
lately been formed, and of which I am a member. We have adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the name of a society I have before mentioned, and which is not
now in existence. We call it ‘The Society for Literary Improvement;’
our place of assembly is a large room in Great Charles Street.
There are at present about twenty members, who lecture in rotation.
After the lecture, which is but short, a discussion on the subject
follows.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“<i>December, 1820.</i>—During the last half-year I have continued the
subject of Astronomy, by giving two lectures on the Solar System. I
also opened the discussion at one of our monthly meetings by an
address ‘On the nature and utility of systematic arrangements.’”
Each of these lectures was delivered from short notes. At the first
lecture on Astronomy, I was so completely taken-up with my subject
that I was not aware how fast time was flying, till, looking at my
watch, I found that I had been speaking an hour and three-quarters.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“<i>November, 1821.</i>—Since February, which is the date of the last
entry in this book, I have delivered two lectures before the Society
for Literary and Scientific Improvement; one on Comets and the
Asteroids, the other on the Fixed Stars.</p>

<p>“We have adopted a plan of electing a committee which secures a
very exact representation of the whole body. Every member is
returned by unanimous votes, and he may be recalled at any moment
by a resolution of the majority of his constituents, who may then
return another representative, but this must be done by a unanimous
vote. Very much to my surprise, I was the first member elected.”</p>

</div>

<p>The plan of election had been devised by his father,
who, as I have already said, was strongly in favour
of the representation of minorities. I have before me a
copy of the laws of this society. The tenth, in which
the mode of election is described, I give below:—<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>On a loose sheet of paper that I have found, I find
the following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The objects proposed in arranging the plan of choosing the
Committee are:—</p>

<p>“1st. A fair representation (as near as can be) of all the classes of
which the general body is composed.</p>

<p>“2nd. Responsibility on the part of the members of the Committee.</p>

<p>“To obtain the first of these objects, it has been provided that each
member of the Committee shall be chosen by a <i>section only</i> of the
society; and, as will appear upon examination, opportunity is afforded,
in forming the sections, for every voter to class himself with those
whose views most resemble his own.</p>

<p>“To obtain the second object, frequent elections are appointed, and
to every section of the society is secured an undoubted right to the
services of one individual member of the Committee. Added to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are the provisions that the proceedings of the Committee may be
attended by any member of the society as an auditor, and that a
public register is to be kept of the attendance, or non-attendance, of
each member of the Committee.”</p>

</div>

<p>Some months after the Society had been founded
Rowland Hill made the following entry in his
Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Society for Scientific and Literary Improvement has gradually
increased in numbers and importance ever since its establishment.
We have had some excellent lectures, and I always look forward to
the night of meeting with pleasure. I am still a member of the
Committee. Our time has been very much occupied in revising the
Laws, which we have now printed. At the request of the Committee
I wrote the Preface which is annexed to the Laws.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If the Society
should ever become numerous, which now appears probable, I am
confident, from the form of its constitution, that it will become a
formidable body.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the following passage in the Preface, its author
was stating, no doubt, the difficulties which he had
himself undergone:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The experience of almost every one who has passed the time
usually devoted to education, but who still feels desirous of improvement,
must have convinced him of the difficulty of regularly devoting
his leisure hours to the object he has in view, from the want of
constantly acting motives, and the absence of regulations which can
enforce the observance of stated times. However strong the resolutions
he has made, and whatever may be his conviction of the
necessity of adhering to them, trivial engagements, which might
easily be avoided, will furnish him, from time to time, with excuses
to himself for his neglect of study. Thus may he spend year after
year, constantly wishing for improvement, but as constantly neglecting
the means of it, and old age may come upon him before he has
accomplished the object of his desires; then will he look back with
regret on the many opportunities he has lost, and acknowledge in
despair that the time is gone by.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>With much vigour does he defend the mode of
election:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Experience,” he says, “proves that, owing to imperfect methods
of choosing those who are to direct the affairs of a society, the whole
sway sometimes gets into the hands of a small party, and is exercised,
perhaps unconsciously, in a way that renders many persons indifferent
and alienates others, until all becomes listlessness, decay,
and dissolution.”</p>

</div>

<p>While this Society was in full vigour, yet another
was started by Rowland Hill and some of his
brothers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About Michaelmas, eight of us agreed to form another society,
to meet on the Sunday mornings at each others’ houses, according
to the plan of the old society, which has before been mentioned.
Since that time we have met with the greatest regularity. When I
joined each of these societies, I did it with a view of improving myself
in extemporaneous speaking: this, at least, was one object.
I then made a determination to speak upon every subject which
should come before either society, a resolution which I have
hitherto kept invariably. Besides this practice, I give an extemporaneous
lecture once a week to the boys. At first it was a great
labour to make an address at all, but now I speak with comparative
ease. It is very seldom that I make the slightest preparation for
speaking.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Minutes of this Society I have before me.
Each member in turn “had to provide a subject for
the consideration of the Society, and might propose
either an extract for criticism, an outline for composition,
or a question for discussion.” The subjects
were, on the whole, very well chosen. They certainly
would contrast favourably with those which used to
be debated in the Union Society of Oxford in my
undergraduate days. The following is the list of the
subjects provided by Rowland Hill:—<i>Are Importation
Duties beneficial to Society or otherwise?</i> <i>Paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Currency</i>; <i>Instinct</i>; <i>The Fine Arts</i>; <i>The Political
Effects of Machinery</i>; <i>Inductive Philosophy, as applied
to the Common Affairs of Life</i>; <i>The Effects of the
Extension of Education</i>; <i>Duelling</i>; <i>The Constitution
of Minor Societies</i>; <i>The Qualities Necessary to Produce
Success in Life</i>; <i>Rank</i>; <i>Public Opinion</i>; <i>The
Economy of Time</i>. Among the subjects introduced
by other members, I find:—<i>A Critical Review of
Miss Edgeworth’s “Ormond”</i>; <i>The Possibility of the
Introduction of a Philosophical Language</i>; <i>The Means
we Possess of Judging of Others</i>; <i>The Study of
Languages</i>; <i>Critical Remarks upon a portion of
Kenilworth</i>; <i>Is it better to Admit or Exclude the
Representation of Death on the Stage?</i> <i>Is the
Acquirement of Literary Attainments Prejudicial to
Commercial Pursuits?</i></p>

<p>In other ways, moreover, he was steadily training
his mind and increasing his knowledge. Thus I find
recorded in his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>April 20th, 1818.</i>—This morning I began to learn French, in
company with William Matthews.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We are to meet at our house
every other morning at five o’clock, and study till seven. We do not
at present intend to have a teacher; perhaps when we have gained a
little knowledge of the language we may apply to one. As my time
is so valuable to me, I intend to spend one of our vacations in
France, when I have made a considerable progress in the language,
as that will be the most rapid way of learning.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“<i>May 25th.</i>—We have discontinued the French for the present,
as William Matthews is obliged to give his attention to some other
pursuit.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Some two or three years later is the following
entry:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At Christmas I had an attack of my old complaint—the ear-ache—which
confined me to the house for a fortnight. However, I turned
the time to advantage by reading French with such industry that,
although I knew but little of the language when I began, yet at the
end of the fortnight I could read it with sufficient ease as to be
amused by it. I recollect that in one day I read a hundred pages of
‘Gil Blas,’ closely printed in small type.”</p>

</div>

<p>His efforts at self-improvement were—as he recorded
in his old age—to some extent at least, misdirected.
When he was a boy of thirteen he won the first of
three prizes for original landscape-drawings, which had
been offered by the proprietor of “The School Magazine”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
to all candidates under sixteen. In the number
of the Magazine for September, 1807, appeared the
following announcement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have received several beautiful drawings in different styles,
which do great credit to the talents of the young persons by whom
they are sent, and to the exertions of the gentlemen under whom
they have studied the pleasing art.</p>

<p>“The principal prize is awarded to Master Rowland Hill, who has
given us a view of St. Philip’s Church, Birmingham, and the surrounding
objects, as taken from the playground of Hill Top School.</p>

<p>“Master Hill is thirteen years and eight months only, and his
performance is attested by his father, Mr. Thomas Wright Hill, and
his drawing-master, Mr. Samuel Lines. To him is awarded—</p>

<p>“‘A Drawing-Box, value Three Guineas.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“What,” he wrote in his Journal a few years later,
“was my surprise and delight to find that I had
obtained the first prize! The whole family participated
in my joy, and I believe this was the happiest day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
my life.” But his success, as he himself has pointed
out, had its drawback:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This, and the <i>éclat</i> I obtained a year or two later by painting the
scenes for our little theatre, caused my parents and myself to assume
that nature intended me for an artist. I accordingly employed the
greater part of my spare time in practising drawing from patterns,
from nature, from plaster-casts of the human frame, and, eventually,
from life. Sketching from nature I found a most agreeable occupation,
especially as it fell in with my love of visiting ancient ruins
and fine scenery. I continued to pursue drawing with great earnestness
for several years, and some of my drawings obtained the honour
(undeserved, I fear) of appearing in the Birmingham Exhibitions.
At length, however, I discovered that I possessed no natural aptitude
for the artistic profession, and, consequently, directed my efforts to
other matters.”</p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>In the account that I have given of Rowland Hill’s
mental training, I have, in more than one place, been
carried somewhat out of the regular course of my narrative.
I must now return to the time when he was still
a mere boy, and was as yet but little aware how boundless
is the ocean of knowledge, on whose shores he had
picked up but the tiniest of shells. He would not by
any means have been accounted a forward child. In
any school famous for learning he would have taken a
low place. Nevertheless, his comrades had not failed
to discover his peculiar power. One of his brothers
thus writes about him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My brother Rowland’s character is, to a considerable extent,
portrayed in the History of Penny Postage; and, amongst the rest,
his power of commanding success. But it may be well for me to
testify, relative to this quality, that he showed it from a very early
age. For myself, I can say that whenever I knew that he had set an
object before him, I felt sure that it would be attained; and yet this
was not from any high estimate of his talents; for, being less than
three years his junior, and perhaps of a more sprightly and imaginative
disposition, I fear I was wont to assume in comparing his mental
powers with mine, and certainly did not soon recognise their high
order. Probably, if I analyzed my feeling at all, I based it chiefly
on belief in his perseverance. Again and again I had seen work
prosper in his hands, and had had few or no failures to point to;
whereas I knew that I was ever devising mighty plans which came to
nothing. His early performances were chiefly of a mechanical nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and diligent practice rendered him very fertile in resources—a fact of
which I was well aware years before I could have designated the
power by its proper term.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was in the management of the school theatre
that this fertility in resources first became conspicuous.
His younger brother, Arthur, had a strong dramatic
turn, and was eager, like many another lad of thirteen,
to strut and fret his hour upon the stage. Others
he found ready to join him, and then for aid and
advice he turned to Rowland, who was by two years
his senior.</p>

<p>“The more I told them about the cost and other
difficulties, the more anxious they grew as to the
success of their enterprise, until at length, by their
joint entreaty, I was prevailed on to assume the
management; undertaking myself to paint the scenes,
construct the machinery, and direct the whole course
of action. I declined to become a performer, having
no turn that way.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The young company put their
money into a common stock. The Manager recorded
in his Journal:—“A code of laws was drawn
up for the management of the theatre, and we
were very exact in the observance of them. I was
constituted manager, with power to appoint the
different actors, and, under certain restrictions, to
appropriate the funds in what way I pleased.”</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1811 that they formed their
plans; but it was not till the Easter of the following
year that they were ready to give their first performance.
Their difficulties were great. The school-room
was to be their theatre; and in the school-room
they could only work before the boys had risen, and
after they had gone to bed. In the code of laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which governed the company, it was laid down that
they should rise an hour before the usual time.
Whatever scenery they set up had always to be
taken down before lessons began. The room was
long, but narrow, and not lofty enough to allow the
scenes, at the time of shifting, to be drawn up. Not
one of the company had ever been behind the curtain
of a real theatre. Rowland, however, undertook to be
architect, carpenter, scene-painter, and manager. He
had, by this time, become most expert in the use of
his tools. He was never so happy as when he was
working in his carpenter’s shop. His knowledge of
drawing and painting was also turned to good account.
He began by carefully planning his work, and taking
the most exact measurements. So accurately had
everything been contrived beforehand, that when the
scenes and their supports came to be put up they all
fell at once into their proper places. The young
company was greatly hampered by want of funds, and
had from time to time to turn from the theatre to more
than one plan of raising money. Among other “ways
and means,” they set up a manufactory of fire-balloons,
and gained some money by the tickets of admission
that they sold to those who witnessed the ascent. At
first they could only afford the simplest of materials for
their scenes. These were painted on brown paper,
the sheets being glued together. The side-scenes
were painted on both sides, and revolved, in changing,
on a pivot in the middle. Each season saw, however,
an increase of magnificence, and some of the young
artist’s scenery was so strongly made and so carefully
painted that it has been in use even in the last few
years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his younger brother was engaged in
writing a tragedy, and in drilling his company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
“Finding all dramas to which he had access far too
long and difficult for his purpose, he boldly turned
author; and parts were learned and scenes practised,
though with considerable increase to inevitable difficulties,
from the circumstance that the drama grew as
the work proceeded, new thoughts striking the young
dramatist, and new scenes being added for their development.”
Thus <i>The Hostile Chieftains</i>, a tragedy
founded on one of Mrs. Radcliffe’s tales, was written
six times over. <i>The Tragedy of Nero</i>, as well befitted
so great a subject, was the composition of three of
the brothers working together. Even the manager,
architect, carpenter, and scene-painter had found time
to lend a hand. The first season opened with the
performance of <i>The Rivals</i>, a tragedy, and not by
Sheridan. It was witnessed with great applause by
crowded audiences during its run of two nights. It
was in the third season that <i>The Hostile Chieftains</i>
was performed. Meanwhile, no doubt as a necessary
preparation for Mrs. Radcliffe, a trap-door had been
made in the ceiling. A band of musicians also was
formed. This was the last season of the little company,
but it ended gloriously; for the play had a run
of five nights.</p>

<p>In many other ways did the young lad show his
ingenuity. He was the family carpenter, locksmith,
and clock-cleaner. He even took to pieces and set to
rights a watch which had been returned to the
maker for repairs, but was sent back as faulty as
ever. When he was sixteen Mr. Beasley projected
a new piece of “utility”—a school-atlas—and called
upon “his young friend, Rowland Hill,” to undertake
the task of constructing the maps. “This was,”
Rowland wrote in his Journal, a few years later, “a
much greater undertaking than I at first imagined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
owing to the great difference that exists in the works
which it was necessary to consult. In a chart of the
Mediterranean belonging to my father, Algiers is as
much as three inches from its proper place....
I have given it up entirely. I could not be satisfied
with copying from another map, and from the great
number of books and maps which it was necessary to
consult, I found that, with the little time I could
devote to it, it must be the work of not less than ten
or fifteen years.” He finished, however, the map of
Spain and Portugal, which was published.</p>

<p>Three years later, when he was now nineteen, he
gave still further proofs of his ingenuity:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In January, 1815, my father gave a lecture on electricity to the
Birmingham Philosophical Society, of which he was a Fellow, I
performing the experiments. At that period the means of securing
electrical action were either imperfect, or, at best, not very generally
known. A previous attempt (by another Fellow of the Society) to
give an illustrated lecture on the subject had utterly failed; and it
was confidently believed by various members that, in the theatre of
the institution at least—whether because of the crowded audiences
usually attending the lectures, whether from insufficient ventilation,
or from some unknown cause—all further attempt was useless. This
stimulated my father to the effort, the more so as his successful
lectures, previously mentioned, had been given under circumstances
far more unfavourable. His credit was thus staked upon the issue,
and he resolved, and I with him, that no effort should be spared to
secure success. We carefully examined the whole of the Society’s
apparatus, and brought it into complete order. Remembering an
exhibition of constellations at one of my father’s former lectures, I
went to work to prepare more, which I desired to make on a much
larger scale; but glass, the material on which the tinfoil was laid,
being not only inconveniently fragile, but at that time, on account of
the high duty, an expensive article, I tried the substitution of cardboard,
which fortunately I found to be, when quite dry, a satisfactory
non-conductor. Using this, I produced several constellations of
such size as to be well seen by a large body of spectators; and,
which delighted me even more, I so arranged one, viz, that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Great Bear, that while receiving the spark it was kept in constant
revolution. At length we got everything to do well; but our elation
at this preliminary success was considerably checked by hearing that
our predecessor had thus far done as well as ourselves. This made
us very anxious, and our care was redoubled. Observing that the
lecture-table was covered with lead, surmounted with green baize,
and fearing that this combination would in some measure rob our
conductor (the nap acting as so many points), we covered the whole
with glazed brown paper; and again, anxious lest any accumulation
of electric influence, either in the subjacent lead or elsewhere, might
be troublesome, we crossed the table with a number of wires, which,
being first brought into connection below, were passed through the
floor, and lastly, being thrust into the spout of a pump in the basement,
were brought into contact with the column of water within, so
as to make our conduction, or rather abduction, complete. We also
took advantage of a furnace, which had been set up behind the
lecture-table for chemical purposes, to diffuse as much warmth as
possible over our whole apparatus, that all dampness might be kept
away.</p>

<p>“At length the important night arrived, and, notwithstanding all
our precautions, we went to the lecture-room in great trepidation.
The clock struck seven, and the electrical machine, which had been
kept near a large fire in the apparatus-room till the last moment, was
carried in and attached to the table. The lecture began, and the
machine was set in motion, while we stood in breathless anxiety to
watch the result. To our inexpressible relief we soon saw that it
was in full power; and experiment succeeded experiment without
the slightest failure. All had proceeded well till about the middle
of the lecture, when suddenly the rod of the winch, which, with
superfluous caution, had been made of glass, snapped in two, and
the machine was brought to a stand. Though enough had been
done to establish the success of our attempt, my father, naturally
anxious to complete his lecture, and remembering that he was in
the midst of a manufacturing town, inquired earnestly whether any
one present could furnish a substitute of any description, however
rude. One or two gentlemen immediately disappeared, and, meantime,
my own machine, which had been brought as a provision
against mishap, was used for some minor experiments, for which its
power well sufficed. While this was going on my brother Edwin
had carried the broken winch into a small workshop on the premises,
and, sawing off the leg of a stool, had shaped this at the ends, fitted
it to the winch handle, and, returning to the room, attached it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
socket on the axle of the machine, which again began to revolve, so
that when our kind friends returned with their substitutes the
necessity for them had passed away, and the lecture went on
swimmingly to the end; my Great Bear, which was, so far as I
know, a novelty, attracting particular attention, and eliciting,
contrary to the rule and usage of the society, a round of
applause.</p>

<p>“One of the loudest foreboders of evil consoled himself for his
error by remarking on the number of assistants ‘Hill’ had had,
adding that he had better have brought his wife and all his family
to help him. So trifling a circumstance would not have been
noticed here had it not touched the key-note of our success. In
our course through life, from the beginning to the present hour,
each one of us has been always ready to help the others to the best
of his power; and no one has failed to call for such assistance again
and again. Each one, I am sure, recognises in this fact a main
cause of such success as he has attained; and I cannot too
emphatically declare that to mine it has been essential.</p>

<p>“In the following January my father gave a second and last
lecture on the same subject. Emboldened by our past success, we
proceeded to experiments involving greater risk of failure; among
others a thunder-cloud, which, to effect its discharge (whereby a
model building was to be blown up with gunpowder), had to be
moved by electric influence through a distance of not less, I think,
than eight or ten feet. But the crowning illustration, with which the
lecture concluded, was a revolving planisphere of my construction,
four feet in diameter, and representing all stars, of not less than the
fourth magnitude, within forty degrees of the South Pole. Wishing
that the various magnitudes should appear in the illustration, I
devised an arrangement for that purpose. For producing the sparks
to represent stars of the first magnitude, I cut the approaching edges
of the tinfoil into a round shape, and placed them about one-twelfth
of an inch asunder; for those of the second magnitude I gave the
edges a pointed shape, also reducing the space between them to a
minimum; for stars of the third and fourth magnitudes, while
retaining the same arrangement, I produced further obscuration by
covering the one with a single thickness, and the other with two
thicknesses, of thin paper. To represent the Magellanic clouds was
a more difficult matter; but here also I hit upon an expedient.
Piercing the disc, in the proper places, with holes proportionate to
the size and in the form of the respective nebulae, I placed behind
each hole in a plane parallel to that of the disc, and distant about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
half an inch from it, a piece of paper somewhat more than sufficiently
large to correspond with the perforation; and I so arranged
that this paper was illuminated by sparks at the back of the disc.
When I add that the planisphere thus illuminated was at the same
time kept in constant and equable revolution, I shall perhaps be
regarded as justified in the belief entertained at the time that the
whole result was a more exact representation of the starry heavens
than had ever before been produced. The applause previously
given to my Great Bear was more than redoubled on sight of my
Southern Sky, and the lecture terminated amidst the congratulations
of friends, my father being, of course, greatly pleased, myself
sufficiently elated, and the whole family triumphant. I may add
that a full description of my planisphere will be found in the
‘Philosophical Magazine’ for October, 1818.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In 1816 he devised and constructed an alarum
water-clock:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a complete description of this might weary the reader, I will
give only a general conception of its structure. As already implied,
the lapse of time was to be marked by the flow of water, and the
most obvious difficulty being to render this equable, I employed for
the purpose a floating syphon. The tube, which was so fine as to
pass only about three drops per minute, was stuck through a flat
piece of cork, which floated on the surface of water in a tin can;
and as the water issued from the syphon it dropped into another
can, though of much smaller size, hung at one end of a balance; so
that, as this latter can filled, it became heavy enough to bear its own
end of the beam down, while the opposite end, being of course
tilted up, struck the trigger, which, as in ordinary alarums, released
the weight, thus setting the clapper in motion. Now the length of
time required to give the counterbalancing weight of water depended,
of course, on the amount of weight put on the trigger-beam; and
this was varied according to requirement, principally by means of a
sliding weight, hanging from the beam as from a common steelyard.
This sufficed so far as quarter hours were concerned, additional
means of some complexity being used for securing the observance
of smaller portions of time. The end was that I could count on
being called within three or four minutes of the time fixed upon. In
its early days, however, I was sometimes annoyed by irregularity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and, upon careful inspection, I perceived that this was caused by
dust, which, falling into the water, found its way into the syphon,
and impeded the flow. To remove this inconvenience, I enclosed
my alarum in a box, taking care also to change the water with
sufficient frequency. I remember that on the evening when I first
got the machine to work, not willing to leave my new light under a
bushel, I fetched up half-a-dozen boys into the room where it stood,
that they might see and admire. When I had explained the
mechanism, and arranged for a <i>réveille</i> at the end of a quarter of an
hour, the boys sat down in expectation; and probably being over-worked,
according to our practice at the time, one of them fell fast
asleep. Great was my delight, and great the amusement of his
companions, when, at the end of the time, this, the first person
ever awakened by alarum of mine, started up with a sudden exclamation
of surprise and alarm, showing that my little machine had
effectually performed its duty.</p>

<p>“I may here remark that for one machine that I executed there
were many that I devised. Thus I find the following entry in my
Journal about a year later:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<i>December 21st, 1817.</i>—I also wish to make a model of a boat
to be driven by pumping [in] water at the prow and forcing it out
at the stern. This is an idea of my father’s; and I think it will
obviate the objection against driving canal boats by machinery,
which is that the paddles agitate the water to such a degree as to
injure the sides of the canal’</p>

<p>“A few years later I set down another first conception, this time
of my own, which, however, I never carried further. The record is
as follows:—</p>

<p>“‘Steam vessels might be propelled by means of an endless screw,
something like a corkscrew with the wire flattened in a direction
perpendicular to the axis. There might be several fixed at the sides,
at the stern, &amp;c. This apparatus would work equally well whether
altogether or partly immersed in water. If one could be placed so
as to move like a rudder, it would be exceedingly efficient in
changing the direction of the boat.’”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>I find also in his Journal for the year 1817, the
following record: “If I can find time, I intend to construct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a model of an engine which I have long thought
of. It is something similar to a steam-engine, only
that it is to work by exploding a mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen gases. Such an engine I think might be
employed to advantage in driving carriages, as the
gases might be condensed.” A few months later he
writes: “During the Christmas vacation I tried a few
experiments to ascertain the force of exploded oxygen
and hydrogen when in combination, and found it to be
so small that it cannot be applied to the purpose I intended;
at least, that such an engine would be far more
expensive than one to work by steam.”</p>

<p>Soon after he had finished his clock he undertook a
very different piece of work. He had already taught
himself the art of land-surveying. “I learned the
art,” he wrote, “as best I could; I might almost say I
found it out, for I had then no book on the subject,
and my father had no special knowledge of the matter.”
As was usual with him, he at once began to teach
what he himself had learnt. With a class he measured
and mapped the playground and some little of the
neighbourhood. About this time a murder—famous
in legal history—was committed within four miles
of Hill Top, and at once roused a strong public
interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The name of the victim was Mary Ashford. Thornton, the
man charged with the crime, and whom the whole neighbourhood
believed to be guilty, got off at the trial by setting up an <i>alibi</i>. So
strong was the feeling excited by this escape, that it was resolved to
resort to the long-disused right of appeal; and a subscription being
speedily raised to defray the expenses, the necessary proceedings
were commenced. This startling course brought the matter into
the London papers, and interest became general. Illustrated
journals there were none, but my drawing-master published a
portrait of the poor girl—taken, I suppose, after death—with a
view of the pond in which the body was found; and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Birmingham newspapers (the <i>Midland Chronicle</i>) gave a rude plan
of the ground on which the chief incidents occurred. This, however,
being apparently done without measurement, and not engraved
either on wood or copper, but made up as best could be done with
ordinary types, was of course but a very imperfect representation. I
resolved to improve upon this, and, in conjunction with a former
schoolfellow, to whom, though he was much older than myself, I was
then giving private lessons in surveying, I led my class to the spot,
took the measurements, and constructed a complete map, not merely
of the spot where the murder was committed, but of the neighbourhood,
so far as to include the place of the alleged <i>alibi</i>. This was
published not only in Birmingham but also in London, and we
cleared about fifteen pounds by the enterprise. It may be convenient
to the reader to add, though this has nothing to do with my story,
that when the case of appeal came before the Court of King’s Bench,
Thornton, throwing down his glove in due form, demanded wager of
battle; and as this barred all other measures, while of course the age
of ordeals was passed, the proceedings came to an end, and the
prisoner was released. However, he never again ventured to show
himself near the scene of his alleged crime. In the next Session of
Parliament an Act was passed abolishing wager of battle, and with it
the right of appeal. I remember that our family verdict on the
subject condemned the latter half of this measure.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Rowland Hill’s map was copied by a dishonest
tradesman:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Incensed at such rascally treatment,” he records in his Journal,
“I told my publisher I was determined to maintain an action for
damages against the man. On examining the Act respecting the
copyright of engravings, my brother Matthew was fearful that we
might not succeed in the event of a trial, because we had not
specified on the plate the exact day on which it was published. It
said ‘published,’ etc., ‘Nov., 1817,’ I immediately had the plate
altered before any more impressions were taken; but as several had
been sold of the first kind, my brother thought that there would be
some danger in risking a trial.”</p>

</div>

<p>The inventions and schemes that I have described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
were rather the occupations of Rowland Hill’s few
hours of leisure than the real work of his life. It was
in school-work that he was closely engaged for long
hours every day during many a year. His position
was not a little trying. Had it not been for one side
of his father’s character, it might have become unbearable.
He and his brother Matthew, as they grew
older and saw more of the outside world, had become
more and more dissatisfied with the state of the school.
They were both ambitious youths; and up to a certain
age their chief ambition—at all events, their nearest
ambition—was to make Hill Top a thoroughly good
school. Before many years had passed, the elder
brother was bent on making his way at the bar, while
Rowland was thinking how he should reform the
education of England—I might almost say, of the
world. As his views widened with increasing years,
he recorded in his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The beneficial effects which I every day see arise from the improvements
which have been introduced into the school, and the
acknowledged superiority of our system of education, lead me to
think that the combination of talent, energy, and industry which
exists in our family, directed as it is, with few exceptions, to the
science of education, may some time or other produce effects which
will render our name illustrious in after ages. The more I mix with
the world, the more insight I have into the proceedings and opinions
of other men, the conviction is forced upon me that our family
possesses talents, and energy, and devotedness to one object, seldom
to be met with.... Our plans are calculated for large numbers,
and to obtain them is the present object of all our attention. Some
of us think that the best mode will be to attempt to induce the
public to establish a large school or college for the education of
the children of the upper and middle classes. Other members of
the family are afraid that in so doing we may risk our present
establishment; but I think that the attempt may be so managed as
not in the slightest degree to injure our present school, but rather
to forward its success. To establish this college is the height
of my ambition. I feel confident that, with great numbers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
great capital, the science and practice of education might be improved
to such a degree as to show that it is now in its infancy.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was at the age of twenty-five, when he had for
some years been the real head of the school, that he
made this record. When, however, his brother and he
first began their reforms, their efforts were turned to
much smaller matters. Matthew set about improving
the teaching, while Rowland chiefly took in hand
the organization of the school and the management
of the accounts. As regards most of their changes,
their father at first showed, if not great unwillingness,
at all events considerable indifference. Often they had
to set themselves against some of his most cherished
theories; often they had to stir him up to action when
he would have liked much rather to remain in complete
repose. “It is an old sore,” writes one of the brothers,
later on, “to witness my father’s apathy in the midst
of all our exertions.” It was at first no easy matter to
win his consent to their plans of reform, but he soon
recognised his sons’ ability, and gave their powers full
play. Many a man who is too easy-going to carry out
to the full the work that lies before him, is yet “rough,
unswayable, and rude,” when his own children come
forward and do his work with their own hands. This
was not Thomas Hill’s character. “My father,” his
son said, “showed no signs of vexation, nor was he
ever jealous of any of us. He used only to express a
fear that I had got too much on my hands. So far
from being jealous, he was proud of my doing the
work, and used to boast of it to others.” How
highly, indeed, he had always thought of his son is
shown by the following anecdote, which I find recorded
in Rowland’s Journal for 1817:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“My father, a little time since, was speaking of me to my friend
William Matthews, when he said, ‘Once in my life I struck him, but
I afterwards found that it was unjustly; and I’d give this right hand
to recall that blow. I hope Rowland has forgotten it; I wish that I
could.’ It is unnecessary to say that, when my friend told me this, I
felt both great pleasure and pain. It is now about eleven years
since the affair happened to which he referred. Many a tear has
that blow cost me, though my father acknowledged himself sorry
for having struck me very soon after.”</p>

</div>

<p>So much did the young man take upon his own
shoulders, that before he was of age he was, in almost
everything but name, the real Head-master.</p>

<p>“My first reform,” he one day told me, “was about
the school-bell. I was then not more than twelve. It
rang very irregularly. I looked into the matter and
discovered the cause. It was owing to the following
rule of my father’s. There was a monitor whose duty
it was to ring the bell, and a penalty was fixed for any
delay. But any one who happened to be in the school-room
at the time was bound to ring the bell, and was
fined for omission. This was one of my first attempts
at legislation. I with difficulty persuaded my father to
reverse his rule—to fine any one who did ring the
bell, except the monitor. That change was eminently
successful.” In the hours of meals there had also been
great irregularity. The bell was never rung till everything
was ready. He proposed that henceforth the
bell should be rung at fixed times, it being taken for
granted that everything was ready. “My mother
said it was impossible to have the dinner at the exact
time, as a large leg of mutton required more time to
roast than a smaller one. I said no doubt it must
have more time, but the cook must begin earlier. She
gave in on my earnestly desiring it.”</p>

<p>In his Journal for the year 1817 he records: “If
the monitor neglect to ring the bell at the proper time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he incurs heavy penalties, which I take care to collect
rigorously, convinced that in the end it is the most
merciful mode of proceeding.” As he grew older he
was more inclined in every case to fix lighter penalties;
but whether he was dealing with his pupils,
with the servants of the London and Brighton Railway,
or the servants of the Post Office, he always
rigorously enforced whatever penalty had been justly
incurred.</p>

<p>Many duties he undertook, he said, as it was less
trouble for him to do them himself than to be called in
to help another. His father did not keep his accounts
on any good system—he had not even an index to his
ledger—nor did he make them out at any fixed time.
To him they were a necessary evil, and were treated
accordingly. The bills were never sent out till the
very end of the holidays. “I had a great liking for
working in the carpenter’s shop. All through my
holidays I was in constant dread lest my father should
come up to ask me to help him in making out the
accounts, and so call me off from some piece of construction.
At last I said that I would rather make up
the accounts myself, as I got so tired of these constant
interruptions. One of my cousins helped me. He
and I used to rise very early one morning just before
the holidays, and at last we always completed the
posting from the ledger, which before had been spread
over the whole holidays, by breakfast-time, while the
accounts were sent off with the boys.” Rowland was
about fourteen when he thus began to make up the
school-bills. At the age of sixteen or seventeen he
took into his own hands the entire management of his
father’s money affairs, and “a heavy responsibility it
was.” There were not a few debts owing, but in no
long time, by dint of great efforts, he paid off all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was due. “I went round and discharged all the debts,
and was very much complimented by my father’s
creditors.”</p>

<p>About the same time the two brothers were planning
to have a kind of “Speech Day”—an Exhibition, as
they called it. “We are busily employed,” wrote Rowland
in his Journal, in the year 1813, “in preparing for
an Exhibition at Christmas of oratory, penmanship,
arithmetic, parsing, &amp;c.” In the dramatic part of the
entertainment the boys were chiefly drilled by Matthew.
The rest of the work mainly fell on Rowland. Three
years later his brother was away in London, “eating
his terms,” and his father had fallen sick. “I had to
drill,” he said, “the boys in recitation. I disliked
the work very much, and was very unfit for it; but
I had to do it. We always printed the pieces the
boys were to repeat. In the scene from ‘Hamlet,’
where Horatio says, ‘My lord, I think I saw him
yesternight!’ and Hamlet answers, ‘Saw?—who?’
I thought ‘who’ ought to be ‘whom.’ I consulted my
father, who agreed with me; and so we printed it.
Matthew—[the old man, as he came to this part of the
story, laughed heartily]—Matthew was very angry
with me for thus correcting Shakespeare.” He has
made in his Journal the following record of the
Exhibition of this year:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the last Christmas exhibition, the first act of Plautus’s
‘Captives’ was performed in Latin. For this I painted a street
scene, which took me several days. I believe I never worked
harder than when preparing for this exhibition. The boys were
brought to such a pitch of excellence in mental arithmetic, and
their other exercises, that we were obliged to give them a great deal
of practice that they might not recede. Besides this I gave a great
many lessons from home, attended to a class who were drawing maps
and plans; and at the same time painted the scenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“During more than three weeks, including even Sundays, I was
hard at work on an average at least eighteen hours to each day;
sometimes much more. This I could have borne without injury, but
I had almost all the care and responsibility of the school on my
hands at the same time; for my brother Matthew was in London
several weeks just before the holidays, and my father was unwell. I
am not yet recovered from the ill effects upon my health of the
exertions I then made; but, however, that exhibition raised our
school very high in the public estimation. The mental arithmetic
astonished very much, and as we invited questions from the audience,
they could not suppose that the boys had been practised in the
questions which I asked them.”</p>

</div>

<p>To what a pitch of excellence he raised his classes
is shown by the following record:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About the same time there arrived in England an American lad
named Zerah Colbourn, whose power in mental arithmetic was made
the subject of public exhibition. As this was a department in which
I had diligently exercised both myself and my pupils, I accompanied
my father to the performance with great interest. We found that the
boy’s power consisted chiefly in finding with great rapidity the factors
of numbers, and square and cube roots. I naturally tried my ability
against his, and I found that so long as low numbers were dealt with,
I equalled and even surpassed him in rapidity, but that he could
deal effectually with numbers so high as to be far beyond my
management. Thus he would rapidly extract the cube root of a
number expressed in nine figures, provided always it were an exact
cube, for with other numbers he declined to deal. His mode of
proceeding was a secret, which, with some other devices, his father
declared himself willing to reveal so soon as a subscription of, I
think, one thousand pounds or guineas should have been raised. As
this did not seem to me a very hopeful project, I came to the conclusion
that my only way of becoming acquainted with the secret was
to find it out for myself. I accordingly went to work, and soon
discovered a mode of performing myself that which I had witnessed
with so much wonder; and not content with this, proceeded to
consider whether means might not be found for mentally extracting
roots without limitation to exact cubes. This was an incomparably
harder problem, nor did I arrive at its solution till a year or two later.
Each process, as soon as discovered, I taught to my pupils, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the easier task—all that Colbourn ever attempted—became more
rapid and far more correct than Colbourn himself; for with him, in
extracting a cube root expressed in three figures, it was a common
incident to fail in the second, an error which my pupils learned for
the most part to avoid. I may add that some of them became so
quick and accurate in both processes, that when on a public occasion,
viz., at Midsummer, 1822, printed tables of cubes and their roots had
been placed in the hands of examiners, and questions asked therefrom
ranging up to two thousand millions, and of course without any
limitation to exact cubes, the answers—fractions, however being
disregarded—were given so quickly as to lead some sceptics, little
aware of the monstrous absurdity of the hypothesis, to declare
that the whole must have been previously learned by rote. I
reduced my discovery to writing, intending to publish it in a
contemplated manual of mental arithmetic; but unfortunately this,
with other papers, was lost in a manner never fully known,
and to repeat the discovery I fear I should now find quite impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>“While on the subject of mental arithmetic, I may mention that
I brought the pupils in my class to perform mentally other difficult
calculations with a facility that excited no small surprise. Thus
they would readily find the moon’s age (approximately, by epacts) for
any day of any year; also, the day of the week corresponding with
any day of the month; and, by a combination of the two processes,
ascertain the day of the month corresponding with Easter Sunday
in any year.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was with some reason that Mr. Sargant, in
describing his old school, writes: “Our arithmetic
was amazing, even excelling, by our laborious acquisition
of mental arithmetic, the success of the present
Privy Council Schools.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In surveying, also, the
young teacher’s pupils made almost as much progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as in mental arithmetic. He had undertaken to make
a complete survey of Birmingham:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I now made my first trigonometrical survey; taking my first
stations on our own playground (which fortunately commanded a
view of many of the principal objects in the town), and, as before,
engaging my surveying class in the work, both for their instruction
and my own assistance.</p>

<p>“This occupation led me to inquire into the great trigonometrical
survey then carried on by Colonel Mudge, especially that part of
it which related to the neighbourhood of Birmingham, my chief
object being to ascertain what records would avail for our map, and
what further steps it would be needful for me to take to complete
the work. With this view I procured his report, and studied it with
care, finding it more interesting than any novel. I read with
particular interest the part describing the measurement of the great
base line on Hounslow Heath by his predecessor, General Roy;
and I gathered from it that my own base lines, taken one on our
playground and the other on the opposite side of Birmingham,
were far too short, the longer extending to only one hundred-and-thirty
feet. I therefore resolved to recommence my work,
and not only to take a much longer base line, but also to
measure it as accurately as I could. I now give a passage taken
from my Journal.</p>

<p>“‘I accordingly procured some long deal rods and three stools for
the purpose of measuring a line with great accuracy. The stools are
made to rise and fall, and somewhat resemble music-stools; this
construction was necessary, in order to place the rods always upon
the same level.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>“‘I chose Bromsgrove Street as the situation of the base, on
account of its remarkable levelness, and the number of objects
which are visible from different parts of it. The base extends
from the corner of the Bell Inn, on the right-hand side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Bristol Road, and opposite to the end of Bromsgrove Street,
to the wall at the north-eastern end of Smithfield; being
nearly half a mile in length, and so admirably situated with
respect to the objects, that there is not a single obtuse angle
upon it.</p>

<p>“‘Besides measuring with the rods, I surveyed the line twice
with a land chain, properly adjusted, and after making every allowance
for the elongation of the chain during the admeasurement,
I found the difference in the total length of the base, which is
nearly half a mile, to be only three-quarters of an inch. When
the survey is completed, I intend to write an account of it, which
will be found among my manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>“‘I have thought of publishing parts of it in some of the
magazines, particularly a relation of a new mode of using the
theodolite, which I have invented. This mode increases its power
exceedingly.’</p>

<p>“In performing this work it was of course necessary to avoid
the daily traffic, which would have disturbed our operations; and,
as my Journal shows, my class and I, during the three days occupied
in the process, viz., May the 25th, 27th, and 30th, rose the first day
at three, the second at five minutes before three, and the third at
five minutes past two.</p>

<p>“The improved mode of using the theodolite referred to above
consisted in making it do the work of a repeating circle; and thus
I was enabled, with respect to each of the principal angles, to obtain
the mean of perhaps twenty measurements. I may here mention
that the fact of this contrivance happened, on a subsequent occasion,
to do me good service. Some years afterwards, being in
London, I wished to visit the Royal Observatory, and procuring
a letter of introduction to Captain Kater, then a member of the
Board of Longitude, I applied to him for an order. With all
the politeness that can attend a negative, he told me that the
Astronomer Royal (Mr. Pond) had been so much interrupted of
late as to deprecate any further issue of orders save in cases of
absolute necessity. As some consolation, however, he offered to
show me his own apparatus; which, I need not say, I examined
with great interest. In the course of conversation I mentioned
my new device, when, turning to me with a look of great pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he told me that he had hit upon the same improvement himself.
Before I left he sat down and wrote the order; of which I did
not fail to make use. I may add that at a later period he visited
the school, subsequently placed a son under our care, and continued
till death to honour me with his friendship.</p>

<p>“To return to the survey, I give a second extract from my
Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<i>June 23rd, 1819.</i>—This day I completed the calculations for
the trigonometrical survey of Birmingham, and some parts of the
adjoining country.</p>

<p>“‘After completing the survey of the town, I thought it desirable
to extend it for the purpose of verifying the admeasurement of the
base, by computing the length of two lines which were measured
by Colonel Mudge. These are the distance [the respective distances]
of Wolverhampton and Wednesbury spires from a station at Bar
beacon. Colonel Mudge has left no mark to show the situation
of his station; he describes it indeed, but not with very great
precision. He says in his report, ‘The station is thirty yards
north of the plantation.’ I have supposed his description to be
exactly correct, that is, that the station was placed directly north
of the centre of the plantation, and thirty yards from the nearest
part of the clump of trees. If this be correct the station would
stand fifty-six yards directly north of the flagstaff, and this I have
supposed to be its situation.</p>

<p>“‘The distance of Wolverhampton spire from the station at Bar
beacon, Colonel Mudge gives at 48,345 feet. This, reduced to
the distance from the flagstaff, gives 48,355 feet.</p>

<p>“‘By my operations I make the distance to be 48,362 feet,
differing by only seven feet in upwards of nine miles. The distance
of Wednesbury spire from the station at Bar beacon is,
according to Colonel Mudge, 25,140 feet. This, reduced to the
distance from the flagstaff, is 25,098 feet. I have found the same
line to measure 25,102 feet, differing by only four feet in nearly
five miles.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“‘Besides measuring these distances, I reduced the latitude and
longitude of St. Philip’s church, and of the station on this house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
[my father’s], from the latitude and longitude of Bar beacon as given
by Colonel Mudge.’<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>“One other line measured in the course of my operations (I think
it was the one from the station on Bar beacon to that on Clent Hill
near Hagley) was of yet greater length than those mentioned above,
being no less than fourteen miles. Indeed, the triangles became
so large that I had to make allowance for spherical excess, the
rotundity of the earth becoming otherwise a source of error.</p>

<p>“Whenever it was practicable I measured all three angles of each
triangle; and, after allowance for the spherical excess, there was
no instance, I believe, in which the sum of the three angles differed
from 180° by so much as half a minute.</p>

<p>“Those possessed of such instruments as are used at the
present day will perhaps smile at the self-satisfaction with which
I regarded this approximate accuracy; but they must remember
that I had only a common theodolite, such as was in use fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>“It may be mentioned here that, on account of the length of
the lines, communication between our stations was a matter of some
difficulty and much interest. When two divisions of the surveying
class had to set out in different directions for places many miles
apart, for the purpose of acting in concert with each other, of
course a certain amount of forethought and injunction before
starting, and sharp watchfulness on the spot, were indispensable:
spare flags were carried for telegraphic purposes, and telescopes
for observation of the signals previously agreed upon. I need
not say that each signal at one station was eagerly welcomed at
the other, and that its repetition, given by way of acknowledgment
at the latter, was no less warmly hailed at the former.</p>

<p>“There was a little incident on this occasion which, though somewhat
foreign to my subject, I mention as ludicrously characteristic
of schoolboy <i>esprit de corps</i> according to its manifestation fifty years
ago. I understand the feeling is now much mitigated, without,
however, being injuriously impaired. In the midst of our proceedings
at Bar beacon the pupils of another school came upon
the ground, being apparently out for a holiday. A feeling of
hostility soon manifested itself in our party, and that without any
other provocation from the other side than arose from mere
presence; and though the rival party mustered at least three-fold
our number, it was soon suggested, no doubt half in joke, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
should challenge them to fight; if I would only deal with the master
a good account should soon be given of all the rest. This absurd
petition being of course rejected, a more peaceful means was hit
upon for the vindication of our honour. The hill on which we
stood was, and perhaps still is, surmounted by a flagstaff sixty or
seventy feet high, by means of which it was announced to the world
round about whether the family at the neighbouring hall were at
home or otherwise. About half-way up this standard was a small
platform, accessible by a perpendicular ladder; and to this one of
our number, I believe the youngest, proceeded to mount, descending
after a short stay. Though not a word was said, the hint was
immediately taken by the other party, one of whom repeated the
feat. A second of our number was likewise followed by a second
of theirs; but a third finding no imitator, the victory remained with
us. Further, however, to enhance the triumph, the little fellow
who had made the first ascent, having remounted to the platform,
‘swarmed’ up thence to the top of the pole, returning to the ground
with no small self-satisfaction. As no similar attempt was made by
the rival party, enough was thought to have been done for the
honour of the school; and when we left the ground, it was with
the dignified air of demonstrated superiority.</p>

<p>“Before leaving the subject of surveys, I may mention that I
afterwards led my class to measure and plot, with sections longitudinal
and transverse, so much of the Ickenield Street as then
remained on Sutton Coldfield, the length being about three miles;
and lastly, that at the request of Dr. Blair, now well known to every
reader of the life of Professor Wilson, we made a survey underground,
viz., of a coal-pit, his property, near Dudley. This, though
a dark and dirty piece of work, was much enjoyed by the lads, the
more so as at the close of their task they were plentifully regaled at
Dr. Blair’s hospitable table.</p>

<p>“These operations extended over a portion of 1818 and 1819.</p>

<p>“A little incident which occurred during the survey on Sutton
Coldfield may be worth mentioning. A farmer coming up towards
the close of our operations asked what we were doing, and upon
being told that we were surveying the Roman road, inquired,
‘What’s that?’ At this time, the sun, being low in the sky, threw
the depressed parts of the road into sufficient shadow to bring out
alike the convexity of the carriage-way and the comparative elevation
of the causeways on either side, so that the road, not easily discernible
in the full light of day, had now its outlines distinctly
marked. The answer, therefore, was easy, and pointing to the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
line of road stretched before us, I replied, ‘There it is.’ The rustic
looked in the direction indicated, and after gazing for awhile in
bewildered surprise exclaimed, ‘Good God, I have crossed this way
every day for twenty years, and never saw that before!’”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Able and successful though Rowland Hill was as a
teacher, nevertheless he often regretted that he was
withdrawn from duties which he alone could perform,
to undertake that which another might have done
with at least a fair amount of success. “I ought,”
he records in his Journal, “to have nothing to do
but to superintend others; my time is unfortunately
too much occupied as a teacher.” Certainly the
singular system of education which he had devised
required for its proper working the almost undivided
attention of its author. Before I describe it, I
would ask the reader to bring before his mind the
state of our schools in the days of our fathers.
Let him read “Tom Brown.” Let him see what
Rugby was even after Dr. Arnold had for some
years been its master. Let him see the shocking
brutality to which an inoffensive child could be
exposed. I can never think on some of the
scenes of that story without feeling that Arnold’s
great name is stained by the cruel deeds that
were done under his own roof. Had he thought
a little more of suffering and a little less of sin,
he would have been a better master and a greater
man. At the time that Rowland Hill began his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
reforms Arnold was still at Oxford. He was not
appointed to Rugby till six years after Matthew
and Rowland Hill had brought out their work on
Public Education. There had been little sign as
yet of any improvement in our schools. There was
still many a place where a gentle and timid child
was exposed to savage and ignorant cruelty. These
ancient foundations boast, and with justice, of the
famous men whom they have reared. They are
proud of their traditions; and yet I can never
visit one of these old schools without seeing rise
before my mind a long line of unhappy children
who were too gentle, too delicately wrought for
the rough and brutal world into which they were
suddenly thrown, and whose little hearts were well-nigh
broken by the cruelty of an unfeeling herd
of masters and boys.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Continuo auditæ voces, vagitus et ingens,</div>
<div class="verse">Infantumque animæ flentes in limine primo.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the year 1821, Southey thus wrote of one of
the playmates of his own childhood:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The eldest son was taken from the Charter House because he
was, literally, almost killed there by the devilish cruelty of the
boys. They used to lay him before the fire till he was scorched,
and shut him up in a trunk with sawdust till he had nearly expired
with suffocation. The Charter House, at that time, was a sort of
hell upon earth for the under boys. He was of weak understanding
and feeble frame.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I own the value and the force of the traditions
of a school. I know that they cling to places,
and are not easy to transplant; but, were I a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Charter House boy, after reading such a passage
as this, I should feel that I drew a freer, as well
as a purer, air on the open downs above Godalming,
than in the old buildings near Smithfield.</p>

<p>In the instruction that was given there had been
but little general improvement. The old classical
education was, no doubt, in many ways admirably
well suited for boys who were quick at languages.
But it made the dull ten times as dull as they came
from nature, and marked down many a lad as a
hopeless blockhead whose good parts were merely
overwhelmed by the gross ignorance of his teachers.
Pedantry, scarcely less than penury, can freeze the
genial current of the soul. If the fools and blockheads
could only once gather their poor wits
together, and only once give their thoughts utterance,
what a tale of wrong would they pour forth
against the brutal and ignorant pedants who had,
in their childhood, puffed out the far too feeble
light which had been given to light them through
the world.</p>

<p>Bad, indeed, was the general state of education
when Rowland Hill set up for its reformer—so bad
that it almost excuses the audacity of the young
enthusiast. His audacity, certainly, was almost
boundless. “We must honestly confess,” his eldest
brother and he say, in the volume which they
published on education, “that we retain hardly a
single opinion relating to any part of our profession
which we held in early life. One by one we have
surrendered them all to the force of experience.”
He was but twenty-five at most when he wrote this,
and all the wisdom of our forefathers he had already
scattered to the winds. With some reason did one
of his pupils say, “There was a great want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
reverence for authority in his school. There was
no respect for the opinion of the great and good
men of all ages—that <i>consensus</i> of opinion.” In his
old age, Rowland Hill described his career as a
schoolmaster as a series of experiments. In the
years when he was making his greatest changes,
and striking out into the newest of paths, he had,
as he himself said, no misgivings as to his fitness
for his post; and yet it was not till after this time
that he so painfully found out how little he knew,
and how much he had still to learn. He had,
however, this ground for his confidence, that all his
plans did work. In the midst of his boldness he
was still cautious. He had a horror of failure, and
a strong but wholesome dread of that ridicule which
awaits the mere dreamer. Many might well have
thought that such a school as he described could
scarcely have existed even in Utopia, and yet it
flourished in Birmingham.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1822 that the two brothers
brought out their work on Public Education.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Part
of it had been written, at all events, as early as
1818. The plans, so far as the government of boys
is concerned, are almost all Rowland’s; the composition
of the work is mostly Matthew’s. Fanciful
though it often is, dogmatic, and even arrogant in
places, yet it can still be read with pleasure and
with advantage by those who take an interest in
education. The young schemer was, indeed, fortunate
in finding in his eldest brother a writer who could
throw over his plans the charm of a lively and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
singularly clear style. In this work is set forth a
complete scheme for the government of a large
school. From the best method of cultivating the
heart and the head, down to the pettiest details of
every-day life, all is considered, and for all provision
is made. Here it is shown how out of almost any
boy, however unpromising he may at first sight seem,
can be made a good man and a good citizen. Here,
too, is laid down a plan for drying school-boys’ wet
shoes. The brothers, one and all alike, had the
fullest trust in their system. “Even if they had
never made a penny by it,” said one who knew
them well, “they would still have tried to carry it
out. They were like ministers of religion who were,
indeed, paid for their ministry, but who, nevertheless,
taught their dogmas as a matter of conscience.”
The founder was for many years confident that his
system could be worked by others, if only they took
it up with understanding and zeal. He looked
forward to the time when he should see great
colleges on the same system spring up in all parts
of the country, to the almost boundless advantage
of his fellow-men. He has since been heard to
confess that having, after long years, looked into
his code of laws, he thought it far too complex.
He added, with a smile, that he greatly doubted
whether he should send his own son to a school
conducted on such a complicated system.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In truth,
even before he had given up school-keeping, he had
found out the need of greater simplicity, and had
cleared away much of the machinery which he had
so laboriously constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In the preface to the first edition, the brothers
state:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having satisfied our minds that our general theory was correct,
by a long course of experiments, and by the acquiescence of those
who are so much interested in a careful, and even rigorous, examination
of our plans, we have latterly proceeded without the
trepidation which at first attended us at every step, and rendered
the task of reducing the convictions of our minds to practice, a
tedious and painful operation. We now feel our system to be
sufficiently matured for public inspection—not that it is incapable
of infinite improvement. We are far from pretending to a state
of perfection; that we should belie daily by the changes which we
still find it expedient to introduce. But there is a wide difference
between alterations which proceed from the adoption of new
principles, and those which are in furtherance of old ones. The
latter will become gradually more and more minute, until they
cease altogether to effect any of the important features.”</p>

</div>

<p>We may once more be tempted to smile, as we read
of the long course of experiments carried out by a
young man who was but five-and-twenty. It is not,
however, by years but by labour that life is rightly
measured. Rowland Hill at a very early age had
come into the only inheritance which he was ever to
receive—man’s inheritance of labour and sorrow. He
had seen, it is true, but five-and-twenty summers. Yet
far distant must have seemed to him the time of childhood’s
careless years. He had begun to labour early,
and into every hour, into every day, into every year,
he had got the work of two. How much he had
already done is shown by one of his father’s letters to
his brother Matthew, dated April 24th, 1823. Well-nigh
broken down by work, the young man had gone
up to London to seek rest by a change of scene:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope change of place and your good company will be of service
to our beloved Rowland. You are aware that his indisposition
originates in his intense application to the business of the school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and I think it particularly excited by anything which draws hard
upon his inventions; I therefore suggest that the discussion of new
plans is not a desirable subject of conversation.... I most
ardently wish that the dear lad could reflect more on the much that
is effected than on the little that may remain in the state of a
desideratum. If we can maintain our present position—and surely
it is far easier to preserve than to gain—if we can do this, we have
enough to make us very proud and very happy. I do hope that
improvements will for awhile be entrusted to that quiet operation of
time and experience which will slightly tax the mental powers of one
who has done a life’s work in less than half the years he may fairly
hope to pass in usefulness, and who must not be suffered to be worn
out prematurely.”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter was found a few years ago, and was
shown to the aged man who, after his long life of
usefulness, had at last entered upon that period of rest
from which he was never to be roused again. It so
chanced that I called on him soon after he had seen it.
I have this note of my visit:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He spoke with great emotion of the hard work and anxieties of
his youth, and said that he had broken down several times before he
gave up the school. He and his brother Matthew used constantly to
talk over school matters—too much so by a great deal. He had
been lately shown a letter written by his father, saying that he was
going to London for a holiday, and that not a word must be said to
him about business, for he greatly needed rest, and had already done
the work of a life-time. ‘And so I had,’ my uncle said to me, with
a voice broken with emotion.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If any still smile at the young man’s “long course of
experiments,” surely it will be with a smile of kindly
pity and not of contempt. The trepidation which we
are told attended the youthful reformer at every step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is, I fancy, a rhetorical flourish of Matthew’s. There
was but little trepidation in Rowland Hill at any
period of his life. In his early years his daring
would have seemed in almost any other man the most
overweening rashness. But, as I have already said,
he knew what he could do, and always kept well
within his powers.</p>

<p>The first mention of his new system in his Journal is
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Soon after Midsummer (1816), I established a Court of Justice
in the school. The judge is chosen monthly by the boys. The
sheriff and the keeper of the records are chosen in the same manner.
The attorney and solicitor-general are appointed by me. The judge
appoints the inferior officers, as the clerk and crier of the Court, the
constables, etc. The jury consists of six boys, chosen by ballot,
from amongst those who have not for the last month disgraced themselves
by appearing on certain bad lists, or by being convicted of any
disgraceful offence. All evidence is taken, even that of the parties
themselves. No oaths are administered, as we wish to impress the
boys with the conviction that it is criminal to tell falsehoods at any
time and in any place. The assizes are appointed to be held once
per week; but it sometimes happens that there are no offenders.
The sheriff keeps a book in which he enters all the sentences, which
are generally the forfeiture of premial marks, a certain number of
which entitle a boy to a holiday. If a boy cannot pay the marks, he
is imprisoned in a large wooden cage, at the rate of one hour for five
marks. The greatest number of offences are leaving school without
permission and before the tasks are completed.... If a boy
pleads guilty (as most of them do), his punishment is always
lessened one-sixth; but the prisoners are never asked whether they
are guilty or not, that they may not be induced to tell lies. The
sheriff always presents his book to me for my signature to each
sentence, and I have the power of mitigating and pardoning. I
never yet have had cause to find fault with a single verdict of a
jury or sentence of a judge; and I have found that these trials,
besides saving my father and myself a deal of trouble in deciding
disputes and investigating offences (for the Court tries civil as well
as criminal causes), have very considerably lessened the number
of offences. I believe (and I have good opportunities of becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
acquainted with other schools) that our boys are by far the most
moral set I ever was acquainted with. This circumstance may, I
think, in a great measure be attributed to these and some later
regulations.”</p>

</div>

<p>Whether the cage was at any time in public view
I do not know. Before long, however, he and his
brothers came to see how much harm is done by
exposing a boy to public shame, as is shown by the
following passage in the second edition of Public
Education:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Confinement, and disability to fill certain offices, are our severest
punishments;—public disgrace, which is painful in exact proportion
to the good feeling of the offender, is not employed, and every
measure is avoided which would destroy self-respect. Expulsion has
been resorted to, rather than a boy should be submitted to treatment
which might lead himself and his schoolfellows to forget that he was
a gentleman.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few months later on he gave his pupils—what
many a ruler has since given his people—a Constitution:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have long thought that the system of representation might be
introduced with advantage into the government of a school; and
soon after Christmas (1816), with my father’s approbation, I drew up
a set of resolutions, which were unanimously passed at a general
meeting of the school, appointing a mode of electing a committee
for the management of the school. They have the direction of everything
except the school hours and the quantity of work to be done.
We were afraid then of entrusting them with the regulation of these
things, but the committees have acted so very properly, and have
showed so decidedly that they are fit to be entrusted with power,
that I think no inconvenience would arise from their having the
power to appoint the school hours and the work to be done in the
school; however, they show no wish to be entrusted with such power.
The committee is chosen monthly in the following manner:—We
have a list of all the boys, which is arranged once per month
according to general superiority.... The boy who stands at the
top of this list names a committee-man; the two next boys name
another; the three next a third, and so on. If there is not the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
number of boys at the end of the list to form a division, they are
reckoned with that above. The election is by ballot. By a resolution
passed at the first general meeting, all the teachers, with the
exception of my father, are to be members of the committee <i>ex
officio</i>; but I am the only teacher who ever attends the meetings of
the committee, as we do not wish to mix too much aristocracy in the
government of our little community. After a bill has passed the
committee, it is presented to Mr. Hill for his approbation, without
which it is not considered as a law. It is then read aloud in the
school-room by the president of the committee, between certain
hours of the day, and posted up against the wall for at least three
days. My father has never yet found it necessary to refuse his
approbation to a single law. The committee is obliged by the laws
to meet at least once per week; sometimes it assembles oftener than
that. They appoint the officers of the Court of Justice, who were
before appointed by the whole school. We derive many advantages
from this form of government in the school. One advantage, and
that not an inconsiderable one, is that it teaches the boys the manner
in which public meetings ought to be conducted; a species of knowledge
in which, if we may judge from some late specimens, the
present generation is particularly ignorant. But the effect of most
importance attending this mode of governing is that it has the best
effect upon the morals of the scholars. Of course the committee will
consist of boys whose age or superior acquirements give them a lead
in all the affairs of the school; and it is of the utmost importance
that these boys should lead the others the right road, and not astray,
as is too frequently the case. Now they feel themselves under some
obligation not to break those laws which they themselves have
assisted in enacting, and the scholars cannot complain that the laws
are too severe, because, either in their own proper persons or in those
of their representatives, they must have assisted in passing them.
The consequence has been that, since things have been so constructed,
we have gone on much more pleasantly to all parties than
before.”</p>

</div>

<p>About the same time that the Constitution was
granted, a Benevolent Society was formed amongst
the boys:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In February last (1817) my father advised the boys to raise a
subscription among themselves to be applied to benevolent purposes;
and, that they might not become too soon tired, he recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that they should subscribe small sums. They immediately entered
into his views with great spirit; the names of subscribers were set
down, and a general meeting was called for the next day. At this
meeting resolutions were entered into for the regulation of the
Society, and a committee, consisting of seven boys, was elected to
dispose of the funds. The committee meets once per week. A
general meeting is held once in every month to receive the report of
the committee, to elect a new one, pass the accounts, &amp;c. I was
elected treasurer, and still keep the office. The weekly subscriptions
amount to rather more than five shillings; donations and
forfeits generally make it up to about six shillings. The boys have
been able to relieve many poor families with bacon and potatoes, or
bread. I consider everything of this kind as doubly advantageous,
because at the same time that the distressed are relieved, the
attention of the boys is directed in a good channel. It finds them
something to do and to think about. Boys will be acting, and if
they cannot do good, they will do mischief.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the autumn of the following year further reforms
were carried out:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>October 10th, 1818.</i>—A few weeks ago the following law was
passed by the committee:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Resolved—That on the same day as that on which the judge
is appointed, a magistrate shall be elected in the same manner (that
is by ballot). This officer shall have the appointment of the
constables, who shall be under his direction. These officers shall
constitute the police, and their duty shall be the detection, and, in
some cases, the punishment of crime. The magistrate shall levy all
penalties not exceeding ten premial marks, and decide disputes
respecting extra work, games, &amp;c., the parties having the right of
appeal to a teacher, or to the Court of Justice; but, if the appellant
should be unsuccessful, the punishment shall be doubled. In cases
which, from their importance, do not come under the cognizance of
the magistrate, he shall order the attorney-general to bring the
offending party to trial at the next assizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘The magistrate may hold his court in any part of the school
premises, and if any one shall refuse to attend, either as culprit or
witness, after having received a verbal or written order, from the
magistrate in person, or from either of the constables, he shall
subject himself to the fine of twenty premial marks. Any one
thinking himself unjustly detained by the magistrate or his officers,
shall have his action for damages, to be assessed by the jury. It
shall be considered the duty of the magistrate to examine into every
offence, and punish the aggressor as early as possible after the
offence is committed. If the magistrate shall neglect his duty (that
is to say if any offence shall come to the knowledge of a teacher
which has not been punished within a proper time by the magistrate),
it shall be considered the duty of the committee to remove him from
his office. But if the magistrate shall go through his duty to the
satisfaction of the committee, the master shall be requested to
reward him with permission to give to any number of his schoolfellows,
not exceeding six, an afternoon’s holiday, which he may
enjoy with them. The magistrate may also reward his constables,
by giving to each of them an afternoon’s holiday, and the privilege
of choosing either one or two schoolfellows to enjoy it with them.
When the magistrate shall be absent from school, he shall appoint a
deputy, for whose acts he shall be responsible.</p>

<p>“‘This appointment of a magistrate has saved me a deal of
trouble in punishing slight offences and deciding disputes. It
appears quite to have put a stop to a practice which before we
never found it possible to check—namely, that of throwing stones.
Indeed, it is a very great improvement in the management of the
school, as from the nature of the magistrate’s reward, every one is
interested in his performing his duty as much as possible to the
satisfaction of the master. Another improvement in the discipline
of the school is a regulation made a few months ago, which is that
when a boy above the age of twelve leaves the school, a subcommittee
is appointed to draw up his character, subject to the
revisal of the general committee, after which it is entered in a book
kept for the purpose, and read aloud before the whole school. This
law has had an excellent effect upon all; but particularly upon the
elder boys. It is generally the case at schools that, a short time
before a boy is about to leave, he finds his character at school to be
less and less important as the time for his leaving approaches, the
consequence of which is that he becomes careless about it, and gives
a deal of trouble to his teachers. But with us the case is exactly
reversed: as the time for leaving approaches, the boy is aware that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
his conduct will have a greater and greater effect upon the character
he is to leave behind him, and his behaviour is accordingly better
each day till the time of his removal arrives.’”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The next entry on the subject of reforms in the
school is dated July 11th, 1820:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is now more than six months since I made any entry in this
Journal; during that time I have been engaged in business almost
incessantly. I have introduced many improvements into our system
lately, the most prominent of which is the adaptation of music to
our evolutions. The boys form in classes, march to their places, to
their meals, to bed, down in the morning, &amp;c., to music; the consequence
of which is that every movement is made in one-half of the
time it formerly occupied, and with one-tenth part of the noise.
Another advantage is the great practice it gives to the band, which
now plays nineteen times a day, without the least injurious effect to
the health of the performers, as they are engaged but for a minute
or two each time.</p>

<p>“I believe I have before mentioned that we have been enabled to
abolish corporal punishment in the school; but as I then looked
upon it as an experiment, I could not speak so confidently of the
result as I now can. It is nearly two years and a-half since the
experiment was first tried, so that I now think it decisive. The
result has far surpassed my most sanguine expectations. Since its
adoption the plan has at various times received many improvements.
A detailed account of it may be seen in a work we are now preparing
for the press, which contains a complete description of our system of
government in the school. All that is here necessary for me to say
is, that every punishment consists in the forfeiture of counters, which
are the currency of the school, and which are obtained by excelling
in the different classes, by filling various offices, but principally by
work which is done out of the school hours. The system is so
arranged that the boys are induced to perform these tasks before the
fines are incurred, so that while they are thus engaged they have not
the disagreeable feeling that they are working for punishment,—therefore
the work is performed with pleasure. Our object in
instituting this plan was to remove the disagreeable necessity of
corporal punishment: this we have completely accomplished; but,
in effecting that, we have derived advantages which were not
anticipated, and which are still more important.</p>

<p>“These counters can be obtained by work of almost every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
description, done at any time; and there is no one scarcely who is
either so deficient in talent or so indolent, but that some occupation
can be found in which he will engage with pleasure. [His father,
ten years before this, had written, ‘Those who do anything may, in
almost all cases, perhaps in all without exception, be brought to do
useful things.’] Indeed, there have been repeated instances of boys
who have entered the school with the worst of characters for idleness
or for stupidity, who, having been induced by example to engage in
some pursuit which they could follow with pleasure and with credit,
have thus acquired a taste for excellence which has extended to
other things, and have ultimately risen to a very respectable rank in
the school. In short, this has become the most important part of
our system. The school is now, as it were, a little world. The
counters are our currency; trades and professions of various kinds,
from the improvisiatore and banker to the musician, punch-keeper,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and serving-man are carried on among us. Here may be seen the
boy of talent exercising his ingenuity to obtain opulence by the most
speedy and effectual means, engaged, perhaps, in the construction
of some curious and difficult model, or in rendering into English verse
the poetry of his favourite author of antiquity; there the industrious
boy may be seen who, already rich, from the love of wealth or the
love of riches, is plodding on to increase his stores; and, alas! not
unfrequently may be seen the little bankrupt, asking the charity of
his friends, or parting with his last marble to save himself from the
terrors of a gaol.</p>

<p>“Indeed, the whole machine of the school (for such is the
regularity of our proceedings that the appellation is not misapplied)
is now become so very perfect that we are able to
appropriate every minute of the day to its respective use; and the
bells ring, the classes assemble, break up, take their meals, &amp;c.,
with such clock-like regularity that it has the appearance almost of
magic.</p>

<p>“I believe I may say that by far the greater part of the system is
my own, and I am not a little proud of its effects.... The
school is certainly at this time in a very high state of improvement.
Our annual exhibition, which took place about the middle of June,
gave very great satisfaction to the audience, and considerably raised
the character of the school. The performances consisted principally
of the whole of the ‘Rudens’ of Plautus and Miss Edgeworth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
‘Eton Montem.’ For this exhibition I painted a new back-scene;
it is a view on the sea-coast.”</p>

</div>

<p>In November, 1821, he records:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About two months ago I persuaded the teachers to agree to
devote one evening in the week to the consideration of improvements
to be introduced into the proceedings of the school. We
meet every Saturday, from seven till ten in the evening, and great
benefit has already been derived from the regulation. My principal
object in effecting this was to have an opportunity of operating on
the minds of the teachers themselves; and I find that this has been
done to the advantage of us all.”</p>

</div>

<p>“No chance visitor,” I have been informed by one
who knew the school well, “had on that evening the
slightest chance of seeing any of the family. The
boys,” he added, “dreaded the conference of teachers,
from the effect it had on them. It kept everything
in such excessive rigidity.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 10th, 1823.</i>—I find the conference a most powerful
engine. It is true that I have given up to it much power which I
previously possessed, but this, perhaps, is more a nominal than a real
sacrifice, and I believe myself to be so true a friend to liberty, as to
like to see others exercise power as well as myself; and this, I think,
few liberty men can say.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Journal affords, however, but an imperfect
record of this active little commonwealth. It is
in “Public Education” that the constitution and
its working are described at length. Their chief
aims are thus briefly summed-up in the following
passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great features of the object we have in view will have been
already appreciated, we hope, by the intelligent reader. We shall be
disappointed if he have not already discovered that by the establishment
of a system of legislation and jurisprudence, wherein the power
of the master is bounded by general rules, and the duties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
scholar accurately defined, and where the boys themselves are called
upon to examine and decide upon the conduct of their fellows, we
have provided a course of instruction in the great code of morality
which is likely to produce far more powerful and lasting effects than
any quantity of mere precept.”</p>

</div>

<p>Undoubtedly the part of the system that would at
first sight most strike an outsider was the power that
was placed in the hands of the boys. Arnold and his
government through the sixth form were, as I have
said, still unknown. His sixth-form boys, moreover,
were not elected by their schoolfellows, as they would
have been on Rowland Hill’s plan. He was, indeed,
to no small extent, bound down by the traditions—the
<i>lex non scripta</i>—of Rugby. But it was by an unwritten
law—a law that was nowhere strictly defined—that
his power was limited. The boys of Hill Top
and Hazelwood had a constitution that had not grown,
but had been deliberately made. A few years after it
had been promulgated, a Code of Laws was published,
which filled more than a hundred pages of a closely-printed
volume. It opens thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“ORIGIN OF THE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p>“Convinced that numerous and important advantages would be
derived from engaging their pupils in the consideration and in the
practice of rules for their own government, from placing restrictions
to the powers of the teachers, and from giving to the regulations of
the school a permanent form, the proprietors, early in the year 1817,
proposed to the school a certain division of powers, together with
regulations for their exercise, which, having received the joint assent
of teachers and pupils, became the constitutional laws of the
school; and, in the confident expectation that the powers placed in
the hands of the pupils would never be employed but for the welfare
of the school, the proprietors pledged themselves not to alter these
laws without the consent of a majority of the proprietors and regular
teachers, meeting in conference, on one hand, and of a majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the pupils on the other. With such joint consent, occasional alterations
have been made in the constitutional laws, tending chiefly, if
not entirely, to throw more and more power into the hands of the
pupils.”</p>

</div>

<p>Fanciful as this may seem, yet for many years the
school was carried on strictly in accordance with the
provisions of this Code, and carried on with great
vigour and spirit. The boys, for the most part,
entered with eagerness into the system, and went
through their part in it with zeal. In an old letter
I read that one day the Committee met before breakfast
for the despatch of some important business. A
motion was made, and carried almost unanimously, that
they should proceed with the business without regard
to school-time, play-hours, or meals. It was not till
eleven that the work was finished and the Committee
adjourned. A jury, trying a charge of theft, deliberated
over its verdict from before noon till after
eight at night. The “School Magazine” records:
“The jury during this time suffered considerably, both
from cold and hunger, having had nothing to eat
from breakfast, at nine, till after the verdict was given.”
In nine years nearly six hundred cases came before
the Court; out of these there were but nine appeals
to the Committee, which formed the Higher Court.</p>

<p>The part of the system which in my judgment is
most worthy of study is that to which its founder gave
the name of “Voluntary Labour.” So highly did he
himself think of it that he always reckoned it among
the three inventions on which he might chiefly pride
himself. The other two were his Printing Press and
his Penny Postage. In an extract that I have given
from his Journal,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> this device is partly explained. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“Public Education” it is described at length: there
we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The favourite subjects seem to be working the printing-press;
penmanship of various kinds; drawing, etching, and painting; constructing
maps, making surveys, and delineating mathematical
diagrams; reading books on which they prepare themselves for
answering questions; studying music; modelling animals and constructing
machines; filling offices bearing salaries; learning orations,
extracts from the poets, parts in plays, and dialogues; taking reports
of lectures, trials, and debates; and composition, in prose and verse,
in various languages. This department, which is now become so
important a feature in our system, took its rise from the necessity of
furnishing to boys who had no chance of obtaining marks by excelling
their schoolfellows, opportunities of gaining them by working
harder than those to whom nature had been more propitious. It
appeared to us that, as in the common course of events this must be
their lot in after-life, it would be well to accustom them to it in their
early years; nor were we without hopes that their superior industry
would enable them to press on the heels of their competitors, and to
show them that talent alone would not be sufficient, at all times, to
secure superiority. It seemed also of consequence to make imprisonment
as rare as possible, both because it is attended with
unavoidable disgrace—to which no mind can with safety be
frequently exposed—and because, unlike labour, it is pain without
any utility, except that of example, which appertains to all judicious
penalty of whatever kind....</p>

<p>... “One of the most valuable habits of life is that of
completing every undertaking. The mental dissipation in which
persons of talent often indulge, and to which they are, perhaps,
more prone than others, is destructive beyond what can readily be
imagined.... The habit of finishing ought to be formed in
early youth. We take care to reward no boy for fragments, whatever
may be their excellence. We know nothing of his exertions until
they come before us in a state of completion.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few years ago Sir Rowland Hill made the following
record as regards this scheme of Voluntary Work:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“One sequel of this plan (it might be too much to call it a
consequence), I mention with the permission of the gentleman
concerned. Amongst those who adopted drawing as his chief occupation
was a little boy who, up to that time, had shown no particular
aptitude for any kind of study. Here, however, he succeeded so
well as soon to attract no small attention. His power was fostered
then and afterwards, and painting eventually became his profession.
Of his eminence in the art I need not speak, the works of Thomas
Creswick needing no eulogy.”</p>

</div>

<p>The plan that he devised for putting a check on
fights among the boys was as ingenious as it was
successful. Fighting had hitherto been against the
rule, but it had gone on much as in most other schools.
He brought it almost to an end by withdrawing the
prohibition. Boys might fight as much as they liked if
the combat took place in strict accordance with the
new regulations. If, however, they fought in defiance
of them, not only the “mighty opposites” themselves,
but also all the spectators of the fray, were severely
punished. “It was the duty of the eldest boy present,
under a heavy penalty, to convey immediate information
to the Magistrate, that the parties might be
separated.” Those, however, who wished to fight in
the manner that the law directed, gave notice of their
intention to the Magistrate. It was his duty to inquire
into the cause of the quarrel, and to do his best to
reconcile the parties. If, however, after six hours had
passed by he had not been able to settle “the swelling
difference of their settled hate,” then he and his two
assistants took them to a retired spot in the playground,
where they could fight it out. Meanwhile,
all the rest of the boys were confined to the school-room.
In later years one of the masters was made
the Marshal of the Lists, and not a single boy was
allowed to be present. In the first three months after
the new rules had been laid down, four formal fights
took place. In the next four years there were but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
two. Informal combats still went on to some extent,
but “in every instance early information was conveyed
to the Magistrate, who immediately separated
the belligerents.” The result was that fighting soon
became almost unknown.</p>

<p>Another institution is thus described in “Public
Education:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Committee has the management of the School Fund. It
amounts now to upwards of £100 per annum, and is partly furnished
by the proprietors of the school, and partly by the parents of the boys.
It is expended, for the most part, in the purchase of philosophical instruments,
musical instruments, apparatus for printing, maps, school-coin,
and books for the school library, the pupils being invited to
recommend the purchase of books or other articles by entries in a
register kept for the purpose. To those who have not witnessed the
prudence and uprightness with which very young persons can be
taught to use power, it may appear a dangerous arrangement to
intrust boys with the disposal of such a fund; but we have never
had the slightest reason to regret the experiment. At the end of
each session—the interval from vacation to vacation—the Committee
prepares a statement of the expenditure, which is printed at the
school press, and each pupil takes home a copy for the perusal of his
friends. Thus a powerful check is furnished, if any were required,
to improper expenditure. The advantages derived to the boys from
the management of this fund are very considerable. To discuss the
various merits and defects of books and instruments, to ascertain
where and how they can be best procured, to transact the business
attendant on their purchase, and to keep the necessary accounts,
must all be useful exercises. Neither can it be doubted that these
preliminaries to the possession of a desired object, very much tend to
heighten its value, and increase the wish for its preservation. Thus
habits of care are induced which are of the highest importance.
Our school-rooms are all hung with valuable prints and maps. The
musical instruments are constantly accessible to all the boys. The
library contains many costly books, and property of a great variety
of kinds is constantly exposed to the use of our pupils with almost
perfect safety.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The punctuality that was established in the school
was very striking. To use the words of “Public
Education,” it was “an almost superstitious punctuality.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Punctuality of attendance entitles a boy to a reward, which
goes on increasing from week to week during all the half-year,
until the progression is interrupted by a failure, after which it
commences anew.”</p>

</div>

<p>It went on not only from week to week, but from
half-year to half-year. If a boy were a single second
late at a single roll-call, his name was struck off the
list, and he had to begin again. “Neither illness
nor engagement of any kind was a valid plea for
absence.” It was his duty not to get ill, and it was
the duty of his friends not to call him away from
school on any grounds whatever. If there was any
marrying, christening, or dying to be gone through
in his family, it should be gone through in holiday
time. In this “almost superstitious punctuality” I
was myself brought up till I went to the University.
There, as I well remember, I received a kind of
shock when I found my superstition treated with
scorn. The first time that I went to the lecture-room,
I entered it on the first stroke of the
hour. My tutor received me with a look of mild
wonder; but, happily, he spared me his reproof.
Ten minutes later in came the rest of my companions.
It was some days before I could break
through the frost of custom, and summon up resolution
to be unpunctual. When, however, I found
out how worthless the lectures commonly were, I
recognised that even the custom of punctuality
may be more honoured in the breach than in the
observance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The rank of the boys was fixed each week, and
fixed on a different arrangement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For one week the rank of each boy depends upon his progress
in Greek, as far down the school as that language is taught. Those
who do not learn Greek follow according to their proficiency in
some other study. Latin determines the order for another
week, geometry for a third, and so forth. Most of the studies
determine the arrangement for a single week each; but a few,
which are very important, decide it for two distinct weeks in each
half-year.”</p>

</div>

<p>This peculiar arrangement is thus defended:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is of great importance that the pupil should, very early in
life, have an opportunity of tasting the pleasure of success; and,
in order to ensure so desirable an end, we have been careful to
attach rank to excellence in each department, sometimes ranging
our pupils in the order of classical attainments; then as mathematicians;
then according to manual excellence; and, lastly, according
to their general conduct and behaviour. Thus each boy in his turn
attains rank and consideration in that branch of study wherein
nature has fitted him to excel, and where comparatively moderate
efforts will ensure success.”</p>

</div>

<p>Twice each half-year the rank of the boys was
determined by their conduct:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In arranging the boys according to propriety of manners and
general good conduct, which is done twice in the course of each
half-year, the teachers determine the rank of every boy to the best
of their discretion. In doing this, however, they are materially
assisted by the various records which are preserved of the good
and bad conduct of the scholars. On the day previous to an
arrangement of this description, all such records are posted into
a ledger, where each boy has a debtor and creditor account, which
every one has an opportunity of inspecting, that he may satisfy
himself as to its correctness.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “Edinburgh Review” for January, 1825, contains
a lively description of the school in “the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of a very intelligent friend, who lately inspected the
whole establishment in the most careful manner.”
This friend was Captain Basil Hall.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After observing generally that he has no hesitation in saying
that the scheme works admirably in practice, he proceeds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘The most striking circumstance, perhaps, is the universal cheerfulness
and the kindly terms which the boys are on with the masters.
I had abundant opportunity of satisfying myself that this was
sincere. There was also an air of hearty attention to their business,
which I never saw in any other school—no languor, no yawning—but
all activity, and abstraction from everything but the lesson.
They all seemed to go about their work like persons who knew
their business, and had no doubts about success; and the frequent
changes from topic to topic kept this degree of animation always
afloat. The various musterings, ringing of bells, music and
marching, which certainly in the book appear a little like trifling
and loss of time, are, in practice, excellently adapted to maintain
good order, and are all performed so rapidly, that although I was
quite familiar with the description, and was warned by the master
from time to time what was going to be done, I could not, sometimes
with the closest attention, follow these movements. In a
written description it will sometimes happen that what in fact is
the work of a moment, and must be performed in some manner
at every school, occupies as much space and is as prominently put
forward as the essential instruction which these mere forms are but
the preparation for. And I think it right to state that, after seeing
the whole proceedings of a day, I am not aware that any of those
musterings and other arrangements, having punctuality as their
object, could be dispensed with without harm. The music consists
of a band of twelve boys. Their instruments are the same as those
used by military bands, and they play extremely well. The study of
music, of drawing, of fencing, and several other similar accomplishments,
is quite voluntary. The play hours of the boys are occupied
partly in mere play, but chiefly in objects having some useful end
in view. They have a printing-press of their own, and publish a
monthly magazine embellished with etchings on copper, and lithographic
prints, all executed by the boys. Reports of their trials are
given at length; the school discipline is canvassed; accounts of the
expenditure of their funds are drawn up in a business-like manner;
and, in short, the whole system is a curious epitome of real life. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
is extremely important to remark that all this, being quite general,
the every-day business of their lives, produces no coxcombry amongst
the boys. They are not converted, as I had apprehended they
would be, into little men. They are still boys, but boys with heads
and hands fully employed on topics they like.</p>

<p>“‘They were all very neatly dressed, and remarkably clean and
tidy—all rosy and healthy-looking, and merry as any children could
be at home. The house is thoroughly ventilated. Their library
is well arranged and catalogued. It is managed, like everything else,
exclusively by the boys. Everybody is allowed to propose any book
for purchase, and the name is submitted to a committee, who
decide.’”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The account that Mr. W. L. Sargant gives of the
school is not so favourable.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hazelwood was so different from other schools, that there would
inevitably be great varieties of opinion as to its merits. The men
educated there have not generally done it justice, and I confess that
I formerly shared in their depreciation of it; yet, when I once spoke
slightingly of it to a near relative who had known me from childhood,
he objected that so competent a judge as my father was well
pleased to get such an education for me. I fancy that the Hills
taught us to be unjust to themselves—that they stimulated us to
aspire to a higher degree of excellence than they enabled us to
reach; that they excited a thirst they could not quench, and thus
sent us away with a painful consciousness of deficiencies.”</p>

</div>

<p>In another passage he writes: “Whatever fifty
years ago might be the merits of Hill Top, it was
a gain to a boy to be in daily intercourse with men
of such ability.” He goes on to say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By juries and committees, by marks, and by appeals to a sense of
honour, discipline was maintained. But this was done, I think, at
too great a sacrifice. The thoughtlessness, the spring, the elation of
childhood, were taken from us; we were premature men....
The school was, in truth, a moral hot-bed, which forced us into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
precocious imitation of maturity. I have heard an Oxford friend
say that Arnold’s men had a little of the prig about them. I know
too well that some of us had a great deal of the prig about us. I
have often wished that I had the ‘giftie to see ourselves as others see
us;’ but I have comforted myself with observing that in later life my
schoolfellows (perhaps, therefore, I myself) outgrew this unamiable
character. The Hazelwood constitution, discipline, instruction, were
in a perpetual flux: the right to-day was wrong to-morrow; we learnt
to criticise and doubt everything established; ‘whatever is, is wrong,’
might have been our motto. We had a conceit that we could amend
everything, from education to driving a horse. This constituted our
priggism.”</p>

</div>

<p>Rowland Hill as a schoolmaster was, in his way, as
stern as Arnold. He voluntarily, indeed, gave up
power, but he constantly held that a master must be first
feared and then loved. He was certainly always feared
by his pupils, and always respected; but he was never
loved. Tender though his inward nature was, yet for
their love he cared but little. He aimed at their
welfare. In the discharge of the duty which he owed
them, he was willing to make any sacrifice of his time,
his liberty, and his pleasures. He ever strove to treat
them with the strictest justice. But he asked for no
return of their affection. Should he receive it, he was
gratified; but was it refused him, he could do without
it. No small insight into his character is given by the
following passage in “Public Education”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We perfectly agree with Rousseau, that the severest evil which
children suffer is the bondage which they endure. We also agree
with him, that the restraints of necessity are more easily borne than
those which are imposed by the will of others. ‘It is in the nature of
man,’ says he, ‘to endure patiently the absolute necessity of his circumstances.’
‘It is all gone,’ is an answer against which a child never
objects; at least, if he believes it to be true.’<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Experience must
establish the truth of this position in every mind; we all know that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
child leaves off crying for the moon years before he submits without
a struggle to the commands of his parents. The cause of this
difference arises, we think, partly from the uniform regularity with
which the natural restraints operate, and partly because the child
observes that all around him are subjected to the same laws. If the
child had ever had the moon, or if it had ever seen the moon in the
possession of another person, it would not be so patient under the
privation. Sagacious parents are aware of this, and take every means
of showing their children that their determinations are as unalterable
as those of nature; and certainly much may be done by prudently
avoiding hasty determinations with respect to children, and by inflexibly
persisting in all determinations when made.”</p>

</div>

<p>In governing his school, and in later years in governing
all who were placed under his authority, this was
the rule that he always aimed at carrying out. By
nature, indeed, he was far too hasty in coming to a
determination. Nay, he was hot-tempered, and even
passionate. No sooner had he discovered his fault
than he set about to find for it a cure. One of the
methods that he took was certainly very strange.
“He gave public notice to the boys that if any one
saw him in a passion he might come up and tell
him so; receiving a small reward for so doing. This
reward was obtained more than once.” He was so
rigidly just that no boy who had played the part of
Gil Blas would have found in him an Archbishop of
Granada. By his Code of Laws he still further put
himself under restraint. Every breach of school law,
every offence against a master, had its exact penalty
fixed. But when once the penalty had been incurred,
it was enforced to the full. His determinations, indeed,
were as unalterable as those of nature. His strong
will and his undaunted courage could not but have won
his pupils’ respect. One of them has told me how he
remembers a day at Hill Top, when a big fellow,
who could easily have knocked his master down, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
him at defiance before all the boys. “Rowland Hill
ran up to him, seized him by the collar, and said, ‘If
you don’t do it this moment, I will knock you down.’
The fellow was cowed in a moment, and, though he
was by far the stronger of the two, at once obeyed.”
This happened, I should add, in the days before the
Constitution had been promulgated, and while the rod
still flourished. No doubt he would have been better
liked had he not been so over-worked and so over-weary.
“There was always in him,” another of his
pupils tells me, “a nervous fidgetiness that things
should be done rightly.” His impatience arose
from an over-wrought brain. But few signs of it
were seen by those who knew him only in later life
in his hours of repose. Life’s evening brought him
calm.</p>

<p>Though the system that I have thus described was
mainly Rowland’s, yet at no time was he without the
help of at least one of his brothers in the management
of the school. Matthew withdrew at an early period
to go to the Bar. His place was taken by the fourth
brother, Arthur. I find the following record in Rowland’s
Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Arthur has made himself master of Latin by very intense application.
This circumstance is a considerable relief to my mind.
When I first determined to follow, at least for the first part of my
life, the business of a schoolmaster, I had no doubt that Matthew
would remain with us, and that eventually we should become
partners in the management of the school. As Matthew was a
good classical scholar, I thought that he would take that department
of instruction, and that I had better pursue the mathematics, a
study better suited to my taste than any other. When Matthew
entered as a student at Lincoln’s Inn, all my plans and hopes were
disarranged. I have been long undetermined how to proceed, and
lately I made up my mind to pursue the study of languages, as I
considered a classical knowledge as absolutely necessary to the
master of a school; but now Arthur has taken that department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and as I have no doubt he will manage it well, I shall pursue my
mathematical studies with increased ardour.”</p>

</div>

<p>The young master soon gave proof of his vigour:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>June 17th, 1818.</i>—This evening and the last some of our boys
performed the whole of Plautus’s ‘Captives.’ They were astonishingly
perfect.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“<i>July 20th, 1820.</i>—In Arthur I find a most able ally in the executive
part of the business. His application is almost incessant, and I
am sorry to say it has materially injured his eyesight. Under his care
the boys have made wonderful progress in the classics. We have
found that frequent exercise in Latin dialogue has been of the
greatest use in the acquirement of that language: for this purpose
an act of a Latin play is learned and performed every month. At
the same time other boys are engaged in shorter Latin dialogues, in
Greek recitation, and in the performance of scenes from the works of
the French dramatists. The very frequent rehearsals which are
necessary, the circumstance of their being engaged in a real conversation,
frequently speaking of real and tangible objects, familiarizes
them wonderfully with the language they are using, and is, I believe,
the nearest approach that can be made to the mode in which
we learn our native language. For this, as well as for many
other valuable improvements, we are indebted to my brother
Matthew.”</p>

</div>

<p>A week or two earlier than the date of this entry
their father had thus written about the two young
men:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Rowland and Arthur are most laborious and successful fellows.
I hope that they are building a reputation that may make them
comfortable in their fortunes. But all that is human is precarious.
Time and chance must happen to them as to all. A good conscience
is the only treasure insured against all risks, and this is a treasure
which I trust my dear children will never feel the want of.”</p>

</div>

<p>The school steadily rose in reputation and in numbers.
Hill Top was before long found to be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
confined for the swelling scene, and a new school-house
was built.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>December 21st, 1817.</i>—During the holidays it is my intention to
finish the plans, &amp;c., and to make a model of a new house, which
we intend to erect in the country, most probably at Edgbaston.</p>

<p>“<i>December 20th, 1818.</i>—A few days ago, without any solicitation,
or even a hint on my part, my father took me into partnership: that
is to say, all our business since has been carried on under the firm
of Thomas Wright Hill and Son. I do not know whether my father
intends to give me a share of the profits of the business, and I shall
say nothing about it myself till he can better afford it, which, when
we have got over the difficulties occasioned by our building so large
a house, will I hope be very soon. Our school has slowly increased
for many years, and we have now upwards of seventy boys.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the following passage he has recorded how he
was his own architect and his own clerk of the
works:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the duty of architect devolved entirely on me, I had fallen to
drawing plans, designing elevations, &amp;c., and after much labour—for
I believe I drew at least twenty plans in all—my work being in a
sufficiently forward state, a builder was applied to for an estimate;
but the amount he named being too large for our means, I had gone
to work a second time, and formed, after many attempts at economy,
an entirely new set of plans, which considerably lowered the estimate;
and on the more moderate expense we resolved to venture.</p>

<p>“It was in the summer of 1818 that the building began. My
father having found that, with but slight deviation from the line of
road, the house might be made to stand in exact coincidence with
the cardinal points, would, I believe, from that moment, have been
almost more willing to abandon the scheme than to lose such an
opportunity of gratifying his taste. For this purpose astronomical
observations were necessary; and my father, my brother Frederic,
and I, sat up the whole of one night (July 3rd) to determine the
meridian. Of course the middle part of the night was unoccupied,
but excitement kept us awake; and my brother Frederic, then a lad
of fifteen, no more sleepy than the rest, passed the time in ascertaining
by measurement and mental calculation the number of bricks
already on the ground. Such calculations occupying the restless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hours of the night were too common with more than one member of
our family, and most of all, I believe, with myself. One night, some
time after this, when the building was completed, I passed a sleepless
period in reckoning up mentally the total payment to be made for
painting, colouring, and whitewashing the house from top to bottom.
Having made the plans, I had all the dimensions in memory; but
the number of rooms being large, their dimensions exceedingly
various, and the charge per square yard differing also in respect of
the description of paint used, number of coats, &amp;c., there was of
course a good deal of complication. The calculation was, however,
completed. On the presentation of the bill I found that the amount
somewhat exceeded my calculation, but I soon detected certain
charges made contrary to agreement; and this error being admitted
by the contractor, the excess above my estimate became so trifling
that the bill was paid without further examination.</p>

<p>“To return a little, I must mention that besides being architect, I
found myself compelled to act as clerk of the works, as without
sharp daily inspection—hourly would have been better if I could
have spared the time—there were constant departures from the
contract, some of which would have proved very injurious to the
building. As I had the main responsibility of the school during
most of the time, and no vehicle at command, the two miles and
back having therefore always to be performed on foot, the work was
very heavy, though probably the exercise involved was beneficial. In
July, 1819, the house being finished, to which we gave the name of
Hazelwood, the school was removed thither; and in our larger and
more commodious premises we were enabled to make various
improvements hitherto impracticable.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The responsibility that he had incurred weighed
heavily on him, as more than one passage in his
Journal shows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am very sanguine that the change of situation will be much to
our advantage. If such is not the case, I shall be very miserable,
as although the determination to build has been made with the
consent and decided approbation of every member of the family, yet
I have been the prime mover in the business, and have become, as
it were, the responsible person. I must own that I am a little
anxious about it.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>A year later (June 17th, 1819), writing to his eldest
brother, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is an anxious time to us all. I hope the experiment will
succeed. If it does not, I shall be very miserable, as I have been
prime mover in inducing them to try it. But, however, at present
everything promises well.”</p>

</div>

<p>His cares were soon lessened. The venture was
found to be a sound one, and the new building
thoroughly answered its purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We find that comfort we expected from the superior convenience
of the house. Every one who visits it is delighted with its plan, and
it is so seldom that a house is built purposely for a school that it
has been the object of considerable interest. At present we have
every reason to be satisfied with our determination to remove from
Hill Top.”</p>

</div>

<p>He had seen but twenty-four years, and though old
when measured by work, he was young enough
thoroughly to enjoy his complete success. Three
years later “Public Education” was brought out,
and Hazelwood School became famous. It was while
the book was ready for publication that the young
enthusiast had pleased himself with the belief that the
improvements which he and his brothers were making
in the science of education would render their name
illustrious in after ages. How bright for a brief time
this vision was, and how it quickly faded away, I shall
show later on. Here I shall make a break in my
narrative, while I recount some of the incidents of his
boyhood and early manhood.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>From his early boyhood Rowland Hill delighted in
long walks. He would go many a mile to see either
fine scenery or an old building. Of what had pleased
him as a boy, he never grew weary as a man. He
had never, he said, to the best of his belief, come
within thirty miles of Stonehenge without going to
see it. When he was a lad of eleven he paid a visit
to Shrewsbury. How deeply what he saw impressed
him is shown by an account which he drew up in his
old age:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those who have travelled along the same road will remember
[he writes] the fine view which bursts upon the sight from the
top of a hill a little beyond Shifnal, and may imagine the delight
felt thereat by three lads accustomed to little but the plains of
Warwickshire.”</p>

</div>

<p>No less charmed was he with his first sight of the
Severn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those who have lived from infancy where a river flows can have
no conception of its attraction to those who at a later age see it for
the first time. The motion of the water, the breadth of the stream,
the barges on its surface, with their sails sometimes unfurled to the
wind, the lofty bridges, with their series of arches, were such never-ending
charms that we could not understand how any one could
regard them with indifference.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Assize time at Shrewsbury, and he was taken
to see a criminal trial:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of all that passed before our eyes or occupied our thoughts
during this ever-to-be-remembered visit, incomparably the most
striking and impressive scene was a criminal trial. The spacious
court, the crowded benches, the barristers in their robes, the servitors
with their javelins, the awful presence of the judge when he entered
amidst the sound of the trumpet and took his seat on the lofty
bench, all prepared our minds for the solemn inquiry about to begin.
The case was one of burglary, attended with violence. The cottage
of an aged couple had been entered and robbed, the old man being
severely beaten by one of the offenders, who all—three in number—had
been subsequently apprehended. Of these, one—whose part in
the proceeding had gone no further than keeping watch at the door
(so at least he alleged)—had, while in prison on another charge,
given the information which enabled justice to lay hands on the
others, and had consequently been admitted as King’s evidence. I
need not say that we felt towards him the dislike and contempt with
which an approver is generally regarded. His fellows in crime,
particularly the chief offender, took their places at the bar with a
demeanour that astonished us, so completely did it differ from all
that we had expected. Doubtless they were seeking to cover their
real trepidation with an appearance of unconcern; but this we could
not then understand. They taboured on the front of the dock with
their fingers, looked about in a defiant manner, and nodded in various
directions, as if in recognition of acquaintances. They were defended
by counsel; and an attempt was made to take the offence
out of the category of burglary, first by the plea that it was not committed
by night (the hour being no later than nine on a summer’s
evening), and, secondly, by the allegation that as the door was on the
latch, the house could not be said to have been broken open—points
made, of course, in desperation, and very summarily dealt with by
the judge. The only further attempt was to discredit the evidence
of the approver, who was severely cross-examined, though the
following short passage is all that I now remember of the process:
‘How came you to think of informing?’ ‘Because my conscience
told me I had done <i>wrang</i>.’ ‘And why didn’t your conscience tell
you you had done <i>wrang</i> before you got into prison for stealing
the pig?’ The evidence was too strong to be shaken, and both
prisoners were convicted. Of course when such a host of minor
offences were capital, so grave a crime as this was on the fatal list;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and we heard the judge, after putting on the black cap, pronounce
the terrible sentence of death. The defiant look put on at first was
still maintained by both prisoners; but when the judge, after warning
the more ruffianly of the two that he could not hold out to him any
hope of mercy, addressed his companion, telling him that, as he had
abstained from violence, his life would be spared, this latter at once
broke down, falling upon his knees, while he poured out his thanks
and promises of amendment. Shortly afterwards the sentence
passed on the other was executed; and somewhat beyond the fatal
hour, while going on an errand, I unfortunately and most unintentionally
caught a distant sight of the hanging body.”</p>

</div>

<p>For many years his excursions were chiefly made on
foot. Though his health was at all times of his life
delicate, yet his frame was active, and capable of great
endurance. He was, when a boy, one of the quickest
runners and best leapers in the school, and he became
a strong swimmer. “I walked to Stourbridge once a
week, to give a lesson,” he records in his Journal.
“This I could do without the least fatigue, as it is only
twelve miles from hence, and I have often walked upwards
of thirty miles in one day.” His fondness for
feats led him, he said, to hazard his health. Thus,
once in a walk of five-and-twenty miles in a hilly
country, he went the last mile on the run. In his
Journal he recorded many of his trips. In the year
1813 he was taken, for the benefit of his health, to
Margate. “We could see,” he wrote, “the coast of
France. My mother was rather uneasy at being so
near to the French.” He walked over to Dover, and
began to sketch the castle and town from the Castle
Hill. Some soldiers told him that a day or two
before a man had been put into prison for drawing
there:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I could not, however, believe them, and went on with my drawing.
However, in a little time a file of soldiers came out of the
Castle with fixed bayonets, and told me that if I did not go away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
directly they would take me into custody. I now thought it time
to be gone, and so walked away to our lodgings, with no wish to stop
in a town where the inhabitants were under a military government.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following year peace was made with France:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>June 3rd, 1814.</i>—About three o’clock this morning the glorious
news of the signature of the preliminaries for peace arrived in
Birmingham. I was up at four o’clock for the purpose of going to
Hagley, to which place I had the pleasure of taking the news. I
never saw so many pleasant faces in my life.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of 1815 he again went to Margate.
How he found money to pay for the trip he has thus
left on record:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My eldest brother and I, who, on account of depressed health,
had two years before been taken by my mother to Margate (much to
my delight, as I then first saw London and the sea), were eager to
repeat the trip, and not having the means at hand, set about to
acquire them. Availing ourselves of such of the apparatus used at
my father’s late lecture, and those delivered eight years before, as
belonged to the family, we boldly determined to give four public
lectures ourselves, the admission to be by purchased tickets. My
brother was to do the speaking part, and I, as before, to manage the
experiments. While, however, we made every preparation with great
diligence, we unluckily had yet to learn that audiences are scarcely
to be collected without full notice; and our notification to the public
was so short and imperfect, that when the day was close at hand we
found that either we must be satisfied with an audience of thirty
persons, or fill the school-room where the lecture was to be delivered
by gratuitous admission. Taking this latter course, we performed to
an audience which gave us abundant applause, but did little to forward
our ulterior object. Nothing daunted, we resolved to try elsewhere,
in a more advised manner; and being encouraged thereto by our
friend Mr. Beasley, we proceeded, after due preparation of all sorts,
to the little town of Stourbridge; hiring a man with a cart to convey
the apparatus, and ourselves performing the journey on foot. Here
our success was considerable, the result being due, I have no doubt,
in great measure to our warm-hearted friend, who was an enthusiastic
admirer of us both, and by no means kept his flattering estimate to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our total profits being sufficient to warrant the journey, we took
it accordingly; intending thereby to get up such a stock of health as
would carry us briskly through the next half-year.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He left Birmingham for London at half-past six
o’clock in the evening of June 23rd.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At about three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day we
entered London, amidst the thunder of carriages and the buzz of
people.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“In the afternoon I went to see the Exhibition of Paintings at
Somerset House. Of the landscapes, Turner’s pleased me most:
there was one, a most beautiful painting, called ‘The Rebuilding of
Carthage.’ Turner is almost the only man who attempts to paint
the sun. It is done in this picture with great success. It quite
dazzled my eyes to look at it. The reflection of the sun’s rays upon
the water was remarkably fine. The Exhibition closed this evening
for the season. I stopped as long as I could.”</p>

</div>

<p>The same evening he went to Drury Lane and saw
Kean. The after-piece was very bad. “I should
have thought that a London audience would not have
sat to hear such stuff.” On leaving the theatre he
“walked about the streets to see the illuminations for
the late victory at Waterloo.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Margate, July 3rd, 1815.</i>—We went to see the steam-boat come
in from London. It is worked by means of two wheels, resembling
water-wheels, one of which is placed on each side of the vessel,
and about a-half sunk in the water. It comes from London and
returns three times in each week. It generally performs the voyage
in about twelve hours. In the best cabin there is a handsome
library, draught-boards, &amp;c. It is surprising to see how most people
are prejudiced against this packet. Some say that it cannot sail
against the wind if it is high; but when it entered the harbour the
wind and tide were both against it, and the former rather rough, yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
saw it stem both.” “There was,” he said, “a great crowd, and much
enthusiasm, though carpers predicted failure, and sneered at ‘smoke-jacks.’”</p>

</div>

<p>He visited Canterbury. In mentioning the destruction
of Thomas a’Becket’s tomb, he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are, indeed, few monuments which were erected prior to
the Reformation but what are defaced some way or other. It is
surprising that people should be so bigoted against bigotry.”</p>

</div>

<p>On his return to London he was introduced to the
painter West:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We went to his house this morning, and saw some hundreds of
paintings, all by West. How proud must he feel in walking through
his gallery to see so many proofs of his own industry! While we
were looking at the paintings Mr. West came by. I was introduced
to him, and had the honour of conversing with him for
some time.... He is a fine old man, upwards of seventy
years of age.”</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after his return home he obtained an appointment.
His father might a second time have written
“preferment goes on among us.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>August 30th, 1815.</i>—At the last meeting of the Committee of
the Institution for the Education of Deaf and Dumb Children,
established in this town a few years ago, my father was elected to the
office of secretary, and I am to be sub-secretary, for which I am to
receive a salary of £20 per annum.”</p>

</div>

<p>About this appointment he thus wrote in later
years:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This post I gladly accepted, as it would make a very handsome
addition to my pocket money. I soon found, however, that the
duties were by no means merely nominal; the current labour being
considerable, and the minutes, from the commencement of the
Institution, which existed only in rough, having all to be transcribed.
This appointment was very useful to me, as I was called upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
transact semi-public business, and was, moreover, at the meetings of
the committee and elsewhere, brought into contact with men whose
superior attainments made me feel keenly the necessity for increasing
my own. This post I retained until the increasing demands of the
school compelled me to give it up.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer holidays of the next year (1816)
he made with some of his companions a tour in
Derbyshire. He thus describes two of the views
that he saw:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The views in this valley, varying at every step, are extremely
beautiful. Sometimes the river is pent in between the surrounding
hills, and the eye is at a loss to discover the passage by which it
enters or leaves the valley. Proceed a little further, and the
spectator is enchanted with the long perspective of woody hills and
barren rocks between which the rapid Derwent pours its foaming
waters.... As we sat with the window open to enjoy the
freshness of the air, the massive outline of the opposite rocks, just
distinguished through the gloom of night, and the silence of evening,
which was only broken by the low murmur occasioned by a fall in
the river, created very pleasing sensations in our minds. It was a
kind of <i>silence hearable</i>, if I may be allowed to use a parody.”</p>

</div>

<p>They went to see a great chasm in the earth called
Elden Hole. It was, as they learnt on the way,
enclosed by a wall:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The woman went with us who keeps the key. On the road we
entered into a discussion respecting the right of the landholder to
lock up such a place, which debate was interspersed with many
learned remarks respecting the equality of birthright, &amp;c., but when
we came to the hole we were unanimous in agreeing that it was
for the good of the neighbourhood that it should be very securely
fenced.... We threw several large stones down the hole.
The noise which they made was at first very loud; it then ceased,
as though the stone had lodged upon some projecting part of the
rock; directly after the noise was continued, but less loud; then it
became a long unequal moan, which imperceptibly died away.”</p>

</div>

<p>On his way home he and one of his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
walked in one day from Ashbourne to Birmingham,
a distance of forty-three miles. For many days heavy
rains had fallen, and the river Dove had overflowed
its banks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When we came to a turn in the road, about a furlong from the
bridge, we were surprised to find the road and the fields on each
side, as far as the eye could reach, covered with water. The top of
the bridge was the only dry spot we could see.... It was a
distressing sight. Most of the fields had but a few days before been
mown. The tops of the haycocks could just be seen above the
water. A great number of men were employed in carrying away as
much of the hay as could be saved from the flood. Whilst we were
waiting, undetermined what steps to take, two men came up who had
ridden through the flood on horseback. They told us that the road
was inundated for a mile and a-half, that in some places it was very
deep, and that the water was rising very fast.</p>

<p>“We inquired if there was any other road by which we could
reach Lichfield (the next town on our road), and were informed
that there was none but what, it was most probable, would be in
the same situation. Our only alternative, therefore, was either to
go back to Sudbury, and perhaps remain there two or three days,
or wade through the flood. As we were both able to swim, should it
be necessary, we determined to proceed. We were able to reach the
bridge by going out of the road and along a field, but could proceed
no further in that way. We now sat down and took off the lower
parts of our dresses, made bundles of them, which, together with our
folios, we fastened upon our backs, that our arms might be at liberty
if we should find it necessary to swim, and waded through the water.
We did not find it so deep as we expected. By keeping the highest
part of the road, we never found the water more than three feet in
depth.”</p>

</div>

<p>They reached Lichfield at five in the afternoon.
Not having yet had enough of the water, they stopped
to bathe in the canal, and saw the Birmingham coach
go by:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After bathing, I found that my heel, in consequence of the
continual rubbing of my shoe, had become very painful, so much
so that it was with the greatest difficulty that I could walk at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
But I managed to double the heel of my shoe under my foot, and
tie on the shoe with strings, and then I could walk very well.</p>

<p>“The next coach passed us when we were within about eight
miles of Birmingham, and then we determined to walk the whole
of the way.</p>

<p>“Before this it began to rain, and did not cease till we reached
home, which was at about eleven o’clock. Having walked forty-three
miles, we were not ashamed to own ourselves tolerably well
tired.”</p>

</div>

<p>Writing in 1817, he records in his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A Hampden Club was formed in this place, I think about
twelve months since, for the purpose of promoting a reform in
the Commons House of Parliament. It consists chiefly of the
working-class, though some of its members have a right to rank
higher.... The conduct of this body of men throughout
has been such as reflects great honour upon them. When their
number was small, they met at some public-house; but our
magistrates, by threatening to take away the publican’s licences,
managed to displace them, and in this way they followed them
from house to house....</p>

<p>“These meetings throughout the country are the true reason of
the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and the passing of the
gagging bills, and other tyrannical acts, tending to abridge the
liberty of the people of this country, and not any conspiracy, as
the ministers wish the old women, male and female, to believe.</p>

<p>“It is very probable that a few individuals, whose distresses and
misfortunes have accumulated upon them till they have been driven
to despair, may have formed the mad scheme of conspiring against
the government; not that I think they were at all connected with
the attack upon the Prince Regent, which, in my opinion, was the
mere ebullition of popular discontent. But what can three or four
wretched fanatics do towards the overthrow of a government, though
they may be in possession of a <i>stocking full</i> of ammunition?<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Since
the passing of these acts, great numbers of people have been
arrested upon <i>suspicion</i> and sent to prison, where they will be kept
during the pleasure of a rascally administration, or till the expiration
of the acts. Great numbers of valuable members of the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have left this country for America, unwilling to live where they can
only enjoy their liberty at the pleasure of the ministry.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the Easter holidays of 1817, he set out on
another trip:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>April 4th, 1817.</i>—After having breakfasted, we set out on foot
at a quarter after three in the morning. We reached Wolverhampton
at a little before seven.... We dined at Shifnal, at a baker’s
shop, on bread and butter. Our dinner cost us not quite fourpence
each.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Shrewsbury he found that there was a strong
competition among the coach proprietors, and that
the fare to Liverpool had been reduced to four
shillings:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As such an opportunity might never occur again, we determined
upon setting out the next morning.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Chester he had time to see the cathedral:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not know whether, as this was Easter Sunday, a better
choir of singers than usual had been provided, but I never heard
any singing which pleased me so much. The organ, a fine-toned
instrument, was played with great skill. I cannot better describe
the effect of this heavenly harmony than by a quotation from the
beautiful poem of ‘The Sabbath.’”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From Liverpool they walked out to the village of
Bootle, where they looked about for an inn in which
to pass the night:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The only inn in the village is ‘The Bootle Hotel.’ We were
afraid of that word ‘hotel,’ and, learning that there was another inn
to be found a little further on, we proceeded; but this we found
as much too mean as the other was too grand for us. We went on,
therefore, and soon came to a third inn; but here we were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
frightened than before, for the sign was ‘The Royal Waterloo
Hotel.’”</p>

</div>

<p>On the way home he passed a night at Shrewsbury,
at the house of his father’s sister:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the evening my aunt showed us four or five letters addressed
by John Howard to an uncle of my father’s, Mr. Symonds, a
dissenting minister of Bedford. Mr. Howard was, at one time of
his life, a member of his congregation. In one of these letters he
mentions the pleasure he received, when at Rome, in seeing the
monuments of ancient art. Foster, in his essay on ‘<i>Decision of
Character</i>,’ mentions, as an instance of Howard’s unremitting perseverance
in the attainment of one object, that he went to Rome
without visiting its public buildings. I am not sorry that the author
was mistaken. If Howard had done so, I think it would have been
mere affectation.</p>

<p>“At about four or five miles beyond Salop, we passed near to
a curious old wall, which stands in a field to the right of the road.
From the materials of which it is built, we judged it to be Roman
masonry. We were all ignorant as to what building it belonged.”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He and his friend were out seven days, travelled
273 miles, and spent twenty-nine shillings each.
Nevertheless he thought that these trips stood in
need of justification, for his next entry is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In reading these memoirs hereafter, I may perhaps think that I
was extravagant in taking so many journeys; but it is necessary
to my health. Without a journey about once a year, I never should
be able to go through the business that I do. Towards the end of
the half-year I always get thin and pale, and my headache (which for
the last two years, with the exception of the holidays, has been
almost constant,) generally is worse at that time, which makes it
necessary for me to take some recreation, to get up a stock of
health for the next half-year; this is the most lucrative mode of
proceeding. Lately an application was made to me to undertake
to give three lessons per week, of two hours each, to a young man,
an old scholar of ours. As I had already plenty to do, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
undetermined whether to undertake it or not; but I argued with
myself thus: If I undertake this business, I shall receive about
thirty pounds per annum for it. I shall certainly injure my health
by such close application; but I shall be able to afford to take
a journey oftener than before, which will put all straight again.
Besides, this is the most pleasant way of proceeding to me; for if I
am to be at work, the more constantly I am employed the better,
and when the holidays come, the more perfect the holiday the better.
I like either to have no business at all to do, or to be fully employed.
The headache has become so habitual to me, that unless it is very
bad, I am seldom aware that anything is the matter with me, unless
my attention is called to it, as by some one inquiring whether I
am better.”</p>

</div>

<p>The next entry of any interest in his Journal is
about his parents:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 11th, 1817.</i>—It is my wish to say something of my parents;
to express, if possible, the gratitude which I feel for their care during
my childhood, for the pains they have taken in my education, and
for their judicious treatment since I have attained maturer years.
But the task is too great, and I shall not attempt it. I hope that I
shall always show them, by kind and dutiful conduct, that I am fully
aware of the magnitude of my obligations. I am thought, I believe,
to have cold feelings; but if any one can entertain stronger feelings
of gratitude towards his parents than I do, his heart must burst, for
it cannot contain them.... My father and mother have acted
most judiciously in using every means in their power to make home
a place of comfort to us. The consequence is that we have none of
that itching, which is so prevalent in most young people, to be always
from home; and I think I may say without vanity that there is not a
family in Birmingham where there is less discord than in ours. For
this we are indebted to our parents, who, instead of interfering in all
our undertakings, as is too common with many enlightened fathers
and mothers, allow us to use our own judgment and discretion; and
when we are in the wrong, rather let us find it out ourselves than by
a continual interference beget a spirit of opposition in their children.
My mother is a woman of strong native talents, but she has had few
opportunities of cultivating them. She is kind, affectionate, possessed
of great courage and spirit, and is well adapted to the situation she
occupies as manager of a large household. My father possesses the
strongest mind of any man I know.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days after he had made this entry he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 13th.</i>—It has frequently been a surprise to me that people
should choose to scald their mouths and injure their health by eating
and drinking hot food, particularly tea and coffee, the goodness of
which they appear to estimate according to the pain it must give
them in drinking it. For five or six weeks past I have had mine
made by mixing with tea and coffee of the usual strength about one-half
of cold water, brought directly from the pump; so that it is both
cool and weak—two very good qualities in my estimation. Lately
two of my brothers have followed my example.”</p>

<p>“<i>May 24th.</i>—For the last month or two I have been in the habit
of lying in bed rather too late. I now make a resolution to get up
earlier in future. It is my intention to rise with the boys—that is, at
six o’clock. That I may see whether this resolution is kept, I will
keep an account of the time at which I rise every morning.”</p>

</div>

<p>He kept up these entries for more than two years;
but in August, 1819, he records:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is now some weeks since I discontinued the practice of
entering the time at which I rise. My object in doing it at first was
to break myself of a habit of lying late in bed. This object I have
accomplished, nor do I fear a relapse; it is therefore unnecessary
that I should continue the motive.”</p>

</div>

<p>In June, 1817, he again went to London:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>June 23rd.</i>—In the evening I went to Covent Garden Theatre,
to see John Kemble play for the last time. He took his most
celebrated character, Coriolanus. It is a part for which he is well
calculated, as it requires a noble and dignified mien. Kemble has
left the stage in good credit; yet I think if he had remained much
longer he would have fallen in the public opinion, as he is become
so old as not to be able to disguise it even on the stage; and his
recitation is terribly monotonous.... The play of Coriolanus
is well known to contain many aristocratic sentiments not very
agreeable to the friends of liberty; and I was sorry to find that when
any sentiment of this kind was expressed it always received the
approbation of the audience. Upon mentioning this circumstance, I
learned that, for some reason or other, the audience at Covent
Garden Theatre has lately become very loyal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“After the play, Kemble came forward to address the audience.
He appeared to suffer much from the feeling that it was for the last
time. Whether this was real or affected I cannot say; but if acting,
it was acting of a very superior kind. After he had retired, a crown
of laurel and a scarf were thrown upon the stage. The manager was
then called. He came forward, and promised to present them to
Mr. Kemble.</p>

<p>“When the curtain drew up for the farce, which was ‘The Portrait
of Cervantes,’ a part of the audience, intending it as a mark of
respect to Mr. Kemble, called out, ‘No farce, no farce! off, off!’
&amp;c. The others, who wished to see the farce, clapped and called,
‘Go on, go on!’ It was doubtful which party was the more
numerous. At length Fawcett, the manager, again came forward
to say that, if it were the wish of the audience that, out of respect to
Mr. Kemble, the farce should not be acted, he would desire the
curtain to be dropped. Some immediately cried out, ‘Yes; down
with it!’ Others, ‘No; go on!’ The poor man did not know what
to do. He again attempted to speak, but the noise was too great for
him to be heard; so he retired, and the curtain fell. This satisfied
but one party; the other became directly more clamorous. After a few
minutes, the curtain was again drawn up, and the farce proceeded;
but the noise was still kept up, and I was unable to hear a sentence
all the night. I heard afterwards that Talma was at the theatre this
night, and that he was much pleased with the enthusiasm of the
audience. He said that the French talked a great deal about
enthusiasm, but that they possessed much less than the English.”</p>

</div>

<p>He went to the House of Commons, and “heard
the Lord Mayor, Lord Cochrane, and some others
speak on the side of liberty.” The debate was on the
Suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a pity that every good man is not also a learned and clever
man. I was sorry to find that the Lord Mayor, whom I expected to
be a first-rate speaker, was very deficient even in common grammar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but, nevertheless, such a man is of more service to the great cause of
liberty than a hundred of your place-hunters, let their delivery be
ever so elegant, and their grammar ever so correct.”</p>

</div>

<p>On June 30th he visited Chantrey’s studio:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I left the Gallery with very great regret, and I am sure that I was
sincere when I told Mr. Whitwell [the friend who had introduced
him] that to him I was obliged for the greatest gratification I ever
received.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following evening he started for the Isle of
Wight:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I left London at six in the evening for Southampton. The road
lay through Brentford and Staines. Near to the latter place, in a
field, I saw the place where King John signed ‘Magna Charta.’
The spot is marked by a sun-dial. I was glad to hear some of the
passengers give it as their opinion that something of the kind was
wanting now.</p>

<p>“As soon as it became light, we enjoyed most delightful views of
a richly-wooded country. The trees in Hampshire are the largest I
ever saw, and the country is almost covered with what we consider
large woods. There is not a finer sight in the world than to be
elevated above an extensive wood, and to see the trees extending as
far as the eye can reach, till they become scarcely distinguishable
from the sky.”</p>

</div>

<p>He went to sketch Netley Abbey:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While I was drawing, several parties came to visit the Abbey,
and I entered into conversation with most of them. One gentleman
was finding great fault with the taste of the proprietor of the Abbey.
He said, ‘Now, if this was my Abbey, I’d get some masons and stop
up all the holes, and I don’t know if I should not whitewash it.
Would not you, Sir?’ I thought this opening speech promised fair,
so that I nodded assent to induce him to go on; and he proceeded:
‘Then I’d remove all this rubbish (pointing to the masses of stonework
which lay on the ground) and fetch some loads of gravel from
the beach, with which I would cover the floor of the chapel, and
have it rolled nice and flat; or I don’t know whether I should not
lay turf instead, and keep the grass cut short, and as level as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
bowling-green. Then I’d build a nice thatched cottage just by the
gate there for the porter to live at; but I think I should have it
within the chapel, because it would add very much to its appearance.
The Abbey would be worth coming to see then; but now the fellow
that owns it must be a fool.’ The gentleman then asked me what I
thought of his proposed alterations, and I told him that they would
certainly make the chapel look very <i>neat</i> and <i>pretty</i>. ‘Ah!’ says he,
‘I see you are a young man of taste.’ I did not think it necessary
to contradict him. He wished me good morning, and walked off,
and I resumed my drawing, rejoicing that the Abbey was in better
hands than his.”</p>

</div>

<p>Crossing over to the Isle of Wight he passed
through the village of Freshwater:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wishing to be acquainted with the etymology of the name
Freshwater, I asked the sailors if the water in the bay was not so
salt as the sea-water generally is. ‘Oh, yes,’ they replied, ‘it’s all
alike.’ ‘What, then, is the reason of the names Freshwater Town
and Freshwater Bay?’ I inquired. ‘Why, they are in Freshwater
parish to be sure,’ was the reply.”</p>

</div>

<p>On his way home he saw Stonehenge:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is certain that great numbers of the stones have been carried
off (I suppose in pieces), and afterwards used in building, as Inigo
Jones mentions in his account of Stonehenge that such was the case
between two different periods at which he visited the Temple.
What must be the feelings of those who could, for the sake of the
value of stones as building materials, disturb and destroy so venerable,
so interesting a monument of antiquity, I cannot guess. I think it
would be well if the government of the country would purchase this
and every other valuable antiquity of the island, and preserve them
as much as possible from injury.”</p>

</div>

<p>In one of the papers that he drew up in his old age,
he thus describes his last visit to Stonehenge:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We also went to see Stonehenge, for about the tenth time in my
life, since whenever there was a chance to visit this most interesting
and much controverted antiquity I never failed to take advantage
of it. But this, my last visit, was a very different affair indeed
from my first in 1817. Forty-three years before I had set out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Stonehenge, in company with my father, breakfasting on the way at
a small inn, a mile or two from the place. While my father rested I
went, sketch-book in hand, to the so-called Druidic temple. Not a
creature, human or animal, was in sight, not even the ‘Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain’ himself. I was alone with the wonderful stone
monument, and nothing but the sky and the vast downs in sight.
By-and-by came a shepherd, chatty and communicative, with fifteen
hundred sheep, and thus only was my solitude broken upon. But
to-day (1860) what a change! Easy communication and love of
locomotion had vulgarized even Stonehenge. We found a crowd of
people making noisy the place, and rudely shattering my early
peaceful associations.”</p>

</div>

<p>In April, 1817, he had recorded his “intention of
making experiments to ascertain the comparative
nourishment which is derived from different kinds of
food.” In the following January he records the
result:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My engagements this half-year are such as will not allow me to
continue my experiments upon food, as I am obliged to be out very
much. I have, therefore, brought my experiments to a conclusion
without having completed them. But, however, I have ascertained
some remarkable facts, as the Journal will show, and I hope that
my trouble will not altogether be thrown away.</p>

<p class="center">“COPY OF THE JOURNAL RESPECTING DIET.</p>

<p>“<i>April 15th, 1817.</i>—I was thinking yesterday that little was
known of the comparative nutriment which we receive from the
different kinds of food we eat, and I then determined to try a few
experiments, from the results of which a table may be formed
showing the comparative value of the principal kinds of food upon
which we live. It is also my intention to notice the effects which
each kind of fare has upon my health.</p>

<p>“I shall live three days upon each of the principal kinds of food,
and take nothing else except coffee, tea, and water. I shall always
drink three cups of coffee at my breakfast, three cups of tea at my
tea, and as much water as I feel inclined for. With my meat and
potatoes I shall allow myself salt, but nothing else.</p>

<p>“That, at the time I am eating one kind of food, I may feel no
effects from the kind which I eat before, it is my intention, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
having lived three days upon any particular food, to take the usual
fare for the next three days, and so on.</p>

<p>“Before I enter on my Journal, I will say something of the usual
state of my health. For the last year or two I have suffered much
from the headache: I have almost constantly been troubled with
bile; but a few days ago I made a tour to Liverpool, which I found
to improve the state of my health considerably, and since my return
I have been tolerably well.</p>

<p>“I began my experiments this morning: during this day and the
two next I shall eat nothing but dry bread untoasted. I have taken
a stale quartern loaf, which weighed 4 lbs. 4 oz. It is made partly of
old flour, and partly of that of last year, which was very bad. The
loaf is rather moist, and a little brown. It came from the old Union
Mill, and cost one shilling and fourpence half-penny.</p>

<p>“It is now seven o’clock at night. I have made three meals
from it, and have eaten about one-third, which is less than I
expected I should eat. I have not stinted myself at all. I am
much the same in every respect as I was yesterday, only that I feel
as though I had eaten too much. I do not know whether I shall be
able to eat any supper.</p>

<p>“<i>April 16th.</i>—I eat a little supper last night. I have been much
the same to-day as I was yesterday.</p>

<p>“<i>April 17th, 6.30 p.m.</i>—I have not been quite so well to-day as I
was yesterday. I am troubled very much with the bile and the
headache. I have a good deal of the loaf left, more, I think, than
will last me for supper. My mother says there has been a visible
alteration for the worse in my appearance since the commencement
of the three days.</p>

<p>“<i>9.45.</i>—I have just finished my loaf and supper. I made no
point of exactly finishing the loaf: it is merely accidental.</p>

<p>“<i>April 20th.</i>—During this and the two last days I have fared as
usual. Still troubled with the bile and headache, though not so
unwell as before.</p>

<p>“The next three days I shall eat nothing but bread and butter,
the bread of the same kind as before.”</p>

</div>

<p>He next tried dry toast, cold toast and butter, hot
toast and butter, bread and bacon, bread and cheese,
rice pudding, boiled green pease and salt, damson-pie
and sugar, bread and sugar; living for three days on
each article. It is not, perhaps, surprising that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the course of the experiments, he one day records
“an acute pain in my left side nearly the whole of
the day.”</p>

<p>The next entry that I quote is of a very different
kind:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>February 15th, 1819.</i>—Campbell, the poet, is now in Birmingham.
He is engaged by the Philosophical Society to deliver a
course of twelve lectures on poetry. This morning he called here to
put his son under our care during his stay in Birmingham. We
consider this a feather in our cap.</p>

<p>“<i>March 2nd.</i>—Young Campbell, who is about fifteen, is a boy of
talent. He has never been at a school, but has been educated at
home by his father. Mr. Campbell is so pleased with what we are
doing for the boy, that he says he should like exceedingly to leave
him with us; but, as he is an only child, he cannot persuade Mrs.
Campbell to part with him.</p>

<p>“<i>March 12th.</i>—Yesterday, Mr. Campbell dined with us. He is a
very pleasant man in company. He related a great number of
pleasing anecdotes; but he did not answer the expectations I had
formed of the poet Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>“<i>August 22nd, 1819.</i>—The people of Birmingham have taken the
first decisive step towards parliamentary reform. A town’s meeting
has been held at New Hall Hill for the purpose of considering the
best means of obtaining the representation of all the unrepresented
people of England, and particularly those of Birmingham. At this
meeting an immense concourse of people assembled; some accounts
say eighty thousand. I was present, and witnessed nearly the whole
proceedings. It was unanimously resolved to appoint Sir Charles
Wolseley representative of Birmingham, with directions to make
every effort to obtain a seat in the House of Commons when it shall
again assemble after the present vacation. The object of this
meeting was treated by the opposite party with the greatest ridicule;
but that it deserves anything rather than ridicule is manifest from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
alarm it has evidently excited in the minds of the supporters of the
present system.</p>

<p>“At our Birmingham meeting the people conducted themselves
with the greatest decorum. Our magistrates had the good sense not
to provoke them by the presence of the military, and the immense
assembly dispersed without the least mischief being done.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>August 10th.</i>—A few days ago I accompanied my brother
Matthew to Warwick, to assist him in preparations for the defence of
Major Cartwright, who was tried at the Assizes just concluded. The
offence charged against him, and the others who were tried with him,
was the election of a legislatorial attorney or representative of the
people of Birmingham (Sir Charles Wolseley). My brother was
engaged for the major, Denman for Edmonds and Maddocks, and
Wooller and Lewis defended themselves. The trial occupied two
whole days, the Court sitting to a late hour each day. The speeches
of Denman, Matthew, and Wooller were, I think, the most eloquent
I ever heard; but in spite of justice, reason, and everything else but
the advice of the Judge, the blockheads in the jury-box gave a
verdict of guilty.... Matthew, as usual, received the compliments
of the Judge. He is rising very fast into fame.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thirteen years later, when the Reform Bill was
carried, the great town of Birmingham was at last
represented in Parliament. “They have made me
Chairman of Attwood’s Committee,” wrote old Mr.
Hill to his eldest son, who was at that time a candidate
for Hull.... “I am glad that you like what I
spoke at the town’s meeting. All I said came from
the heart as prompted by a sincere affection for liberty,
goodness, and truth. Still the fervour of delivery was
not the less because Attwood and Birmingham had
common cause with Hill and Hull.” In that town in
which, more than forty years before, he had braved
the violence of a Tory mob, the old man had now the
high honour of being called upon to propose, on the
nomination day, the election of the first representative
that Birmingham ever sent to the Commons House
of Parliament.</p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>It was in July, 1819, that the new school-house
was opened at Edgbaston with the happiest promise.
Little more than a year later it was almost destroyed
by fire:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Everything (Rowland Hill recorded in his Journal) seemed to
be in a prosperous condition. We anticipated being shortly able
to pay all the expenses incurred in our building and removal, when
an event happened which plunged us all into the deepest distress.</p>

<p>“On the morning of Wednesday, the 23rd of August, 1820, I was
awaked at five in the morning by the monitor entering my room to
take the keys of the lower rooms. I inquired what was the time,
and was glad to find that it wanted an hour of the time at which I
usually rose. I turned in my bed, and in a moment was again
asleep, little thinking of the destruction which, in all probability, had
then commenced. In about half-an-hour I was again awaked, by
two or three boys running into my room, with the alarming information
that the rooms in the roof were on fire.</p>

<p>“In a moment I was in the roof rooms with my brothers, who
slept in the same chamber as myself. These rooms were even then
so full of smoke that it was difficult to discern the objects near to
us. The fire we found to be in a closet opening into one of these
rooms; the flames appeared through the crevices of the door, which,
never having been painted, appeared almost transparent with the
strong light within. The first impulse was to endeavour to open
the door and to throw in water, which some had brought from the
chambers below; but in this we did not succeed, and, after a
moment’s reflection, we gave up the attempt, judging it best to
confine the flames as much as possible, for had the door been
opened they would have burst upon us in such a manner as to
have driven us at once from the room. The whole family had now
caught the alarm. [In the midst of the alarm Rowland Hill remembered
that his eldest brother’s wife, who, with her husband,
happened to be staying in the house, was in a delicate state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
health. He went to their room, and, quietly beckoning his brother
out, in the hope of saving her a sudden shock, told him that the
house was on fire.] After hastily slipping on a few clothes, some
began to remove the furniture from the different rooms....
In a few moments we were all roused from a deep sleep, and
plunged into the most active and distressing employment. No one
can be surprised that at first the bustle and alarm should be such
as to prevent our taking, perhaps, the best possible means to
prevent the ravages of the fire; it has since struck us that by
taking off some of the slates it is possible that we should have been
able to throw water upon the fire and retard it, if not put it quite
out; but this was not thought of at the moment, and the time
during which there would have been any chance of success lasted
but for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“The first anxiety was for the safety of the boys; but, as the fire
was over their heads, alarm on that account soon subsided. As
soon as they had risen they began to throw their bedding out at the
windows, and to remove the other furniture of the rooms, and even
in the midst of all the bustle and anxiety I could not but admire the
activity and presence of mind on the part of the boys. We are
indebted to them more than to any other individuals that the loss,
though it was very great, was not still more ruinous.”</p>

</div>

<p>The fire began in a closet under the roof. It was
so close to the staircase that all communication with
the other rooms on the attic floor was soon cut off.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Order was somewhat restored among us—as much, perhaps, as it
could be under such circumstances; each of the elders among us
having taken the direction of certain things, with a number of boys
and others under his control, when a new cause of alarm arose. It
was recollected by my mother that one of the servant girls, with a
poor woman who came the day before to do some sewing, slept in
the bed which I have mentioned [it was a bed in one of the roof
rooms, which was occasionally used by sewing and washing women],
and it was found that the girl only had escaped. I was at the front
of the house giving directions respecting the procuring of water
when I learnt this alarming news. I immediately ran upstairs,
passed my father, who was then on his way to rescue the woman,
and who generously tried to prevent my going by taking the risk
upon himself; rushed through the room in which was the fire into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the next, and, taking the woman from the bed, on which she lay in a
fainting fit, carried her in my arms to the top of the stairs. I could
do no more: although the whole was but the work of a minute, such
was the effect of the alarm and of the dense smoke which I had
breathed, that I loosed her, and she was caught by those who stood
upon the stairs. I myself staggered down one or two steps, and
should have fallen had I not been caught by one of those who
stood about. A few minutes were sufficient for me to recover
my strength. How the woman revived I do not know, but I saw
her soon after, apparently well, watching the furniture at the front of
the house.</p>

<p>“It afterwards appeared that the girl, awaked by the smoke, called
her bedfellow, ran downstairs and alarmed those who slept on the
first floor, about the same time that the discovery was made by the
boy who slept under the closet, and who saw the fire as he lay in
bed, through a ventilator in the ceiling which opened through the
floor of the closet. The woman, instead of following her companion,
actuated by one of those inexplicable motives which sometimes
influence the conduct of the uneducated, remained in the room very
deliberately dressing herself, and I afterwards learned that when I
carried her out of the room her stays were very regularly laced.
When she did attempt an escape, owing to her alarm, her want of
knowledge of the arrangement of the rooms, and the density of the
smoke, she was unable to find the door, and, after groping about
the room some time, she said that she ‘threw herself on the bed,
and gave herself up for lost.’ Next to effecting her escape, or
making some noise which would have alarmed those who were
about, throwing herself on the bed was the best thing; for had she
been elsewhere I never should have found her, as the smoke was
so thick that I could not discover a single object in the room, and
only found the bed by knowing its situation from having been
frequently in the room. If we had known at the time we were in
the next room, immediately after the first alarm, that she was there,
she would have been rescued without any difficulty. The poor
woman’s obstinacy cost her her life, for although she was not in the
least burnt, yet such was the effect of the smoke upon her lungs,
together with the alarm, that the next day she became exceedingly
ill, and although we procured for her the best medical advice the
town afforded, she died in a few days. The surgeon who attended
her said that she died of a disease to which she had long been
subject, an enlargement of the heart, which was brought on in this
instance by the causes I have before stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“The engines arrived shortly after. I had provided for them
a stock of water by placing some large tubs in the front of the house,
which we filled with water before the engines came. One of our
pumps was undergoing repairs at the time, so that it did not afford
us any water. The other very soon became dry; but we found an
excellent supply from a pit a little nearer to the town, on the right
side of the road. Five men, for the promise of five shillings each,
stood in the water to fill the buckets, and such was the rapidity of the
supply, that not one of the engines was for an instant without water.</p>

<p>“By about eight the engines ceased to play—the fire was extinguished.
Till this time so actively had I been engaged, that
I believe I had not time to reflect upon the consequences of this
accident. But now all was over. Exertion was no further of any
use. In informing my father that such was the state of things, my
throat felt as stopped, and the tears came to my eyes. I went
upstairs, and to the top of the house. The whole of the roof,
excepting that part over the school-room, was destroyed. Two or
three of the beams, reduced to charcoal, remained in their places,
and a few of the slates still rested upon some of the bending rafters;
the rest was bare to the sky. In some places the rubbish was still
smoking. To extinguish this completely, and to search every place
to be certain that all was safe, occupied my attention for a time; but
the consideration of the probable effect this accident might have on
our future success would obtrude itself on my mind. We had
insured the house and furniture, but for a small sum; the first for
£500, the latter for £250, and I soon saw that the loss would be
considerable.</p>

<p>“In order to throw the water immediately upon the fire, we raised
a ladder which had been made a few months before to be in
readiness in case of such an accident. Up this the firemen carried
their pipes, and played almost directly upon the flames.”</p>

</div>

<p>Among the firemen on the crumbling roof, directing
and aiding them, was his brother Edwin. “Observing
that one of the men had difficulty in reaching a place
where the flames remained unsubdued, he seized one
of the largest slates, and so held it as to deflect the
stream, all this being done while his bride stood in
anxiety below.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Another pipe was carried up the stairs, and threw its water upon
the fire through an opening over the back stairs. This engine was
very effective, till a scoundrel (and there were several about who
took advantage of the confusion to plunder the house), in order
to make the confusion still greater, stamped upon the pipe and burst
it. A fireman who saw this, took a short staff out of his pocket and
gave the fellow a blow on his head, which sent him completely downstairs.
I did not know of this till after the fire was over and the
rascal had escaped, otherwise he should have been dealt with as
he deserved. I cannot think of any crime which so completely
shows the absence of all good feeling as to take advantage of
another’s misfortunes, and even to increase them for the sake of
plunder.</p>

<p>“It was necessary to do much immediately. We had all risen
in the greatest haste, and were but half-dressed. The poor boys
had lost all their clothes, except such as were on their backs, and
some which were then at the washerwoman’s,—for their trunks, which
were kept in one of the roof rooms, were destroyed. We were all
wet, hungry, tired, and distressed. The house was completely
swilled throughout with the immense quantity of water which had
been thrown upon it, so that it was impossible to inhabit it
immediately. Our family consisted of almost eighty individuals,
who were at that moment houseless. The kindness of our friends
and neighbours, however, soon relieved us of part of our anxiety.
They provided us with clean linen, shoes, and everything we could
want. A lady who keeps a female school on the opposite side of the
road, kindly lent the boys a change of stockings. Our good friend,
Miss Bache, came with her servants laden with food for breakfast,
which was eaten by some in the garden. One or two gentlemen
undertook the care of the house and furniture; others led away the
people who had assisted to the ‘Plough and Harrow,’ where they
were refreshed with bread and cheese and ale, and all pressed us to
leave the place for a time and recruit our strength. The boys were
divided amongst the neighbours, who took them to their houses.
Mr. and Mrs. Busby, than whom kinder-hearted people never
existed, claimed a right to receive our own family, as being the
nearest neighbours. Here we breakfasted. It was a sad meal, each
trying to appear as little affected as possible, in order to keep up the
spirits of the others. If anything could have removed our distress,
it would have been accomplished by the kindness of our friends,
which no doubt did very much to alleviate it. Invitations for
ourselves and the boys—not only from our immediate friends, but
also from gentlemen whose names we scarcely knew,—poured in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
upon us, and if our family had been ten times as numerous, they
would have been disposed of with greater ease than was the case;
for the offers of assistance were so earnest and so numerous,
that it was painful to be obliged to refuse such as we could not
accept.</p>

<p>“Our friend, Mr. Witton, offered us the use of the whole of his
house at Kitwell ready furnished. Mr. Blakeway, another of our
friends, made an offer, which we gladly accepted, of a house of his
in Tenant Street, which then stood empty. In this we determined
to put up the beds, most of which had been saved, and use it
as a lodging-house till our own could be repaired.</p>

<p>“We were anxious to inform the friends of the children as soon as
possible of the accident, in order to prevent that alarm which the
exaggerated accounts in the first instance generally circulated on
such an occasion would raise. This was undertaken by a friend;
but, notwithstanding the precaution, the good people of Kidderminster,
from which town we had several boys, were terribly alarmed.
An uncle of a boy named H——, whose friends reside at Kidderminster,
happened to be in Birmingham at the time of the fire. As
soon as the news reached him, he wrote to his sister (the boy’s
mother), to prevent any uneasiness which she might have felt had
she heard a wrong account from another quarter. In his haste he
incautiously made use of the following expression: ‘Hazelwood is
burnt down, but Henry is safe.’ The report was immediately circulated
in Kidderminster that the house was burnt down, and that all
the boys except H—— were burnt. The friends of the other children
were in a state of the greatest anxiety. The father of one of the
boys immediately rode over in the greatest haste. He was soon
followed by another. I need not say how glad they were to see their
children.</p>

<p>“During the course of the day the friends of many of the children
arrived, and took their sons home. This, though it relieved us of
the care of them, made us anxious whether an impression might not
get abroad, that either we were particularly careless or very unlucky;
the more so, as an alarm of the same kind, sufficient to induce us to
send for the engines, although they had nothing to do when they
arrived, took place the winter before. We now began to place the
furniture in the school-room and the chamber over, as this part of
the house had not been injured by the fire or the water. Some also
took precautions to defend the house from further injury by rain.
To accomplish this, we borrowed a great quantity of tarpaulin from
the different carriers in the town, by means of which a temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
roof was constructed. I engaged a number of men to remove the
rubbish which had fallen with the roof and ceilings upon the floors
of the garrets, and to riddle it in order that nothing valuable might
be lost. The quantity of rubbish collected amounted to several
wagon-loads. Frederic, and I slept at night in the school-room
to guard the house. We had also a watchman on the outside. The
other part of the family slept at the neighbours’ houses.</p>

<p>“The next day the family again assembled at dinner at the house
of my brother Edwin. We now made arrangements for restoring
things as soon as possible. One undertook the repairs of the building;
another those of the furniture; one to make out the account
for the Fire Office; another to prepare the house in Tenant Street.
Printed circular-letters were sent to our friends as soon as possible,
expressive of our gratitude for the kindness we had met with, and
stating our intention of resuming the business of the school on the
Thursday following—that is, eight days after the fire.</p>

<p>“Besides the injury done to the roof, the floors of the rooms in
that part of the house, and the garret ceilings, were almost completely
destroyed. The garret floors were much injured by the
burning wood which fell upon them, and they doubtless would have
been destroyed altogether, but that persons were engaged, at a considerable
risk, in throwing water upon the blazing timbers as they
fell, before the engines arrived. The walls and ceilings of the lower
rooms were also much injured by the water.</p>

<p>“The school assembled on the day appointed. Till the roof was
completed the boys slept in Tenant Street; when that was done they
occupied the chambers of the house, a part of our own family sleeping
from home. It was not till Christmas that we were enabled to
reinstate everything.</p>

<p>“Among the things destroyed in the flames, almost every one of
us has lost something which he valued highly. My brother Arthur
has lost the accounts of some tours which he has taken at various
times; Howard has lost a copy of Mavor’s ‘British Tourist,’ which
he gained as a prize in the school. But in things of that description
I have been the greatest sufferer. I have lost all my original drawings,
six in number, which were framed and glazed. I made these
drawings when I was quite a boy, and for that reason I valued them.
At Hill Top they hung in the parlour, but when we removed they
were put in one of the roof rooms till a convenient opportunity
should occur to hang them up. The electrical planisphere, representing
the southern sky, and the water-alarum, both of which I have
described in these memoirs, were consumed in the flames. I valued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
these because they were the best specimens I possessed of my boyish
handicraft.</p>

<p>“I have not yet lost the impression which this accident made upon
my mind. My sleep is frequently broken by dreaming of fire; when
awake I often suppose that I smell smoke; and it is not till I am
out of bed that I can convince myself that I have been deceived.
It is remarkable that at the present time, and, indeed, immediately
after the fire, I remembered but little of what took place; although
the roof fell in, and the flames were seen at a great distance from
the house, I have no recollection of noticing either; yet I was more
than once on different parts of the roof, giving directions to the
firemen.”</p>

</div>

<p>He thus accounts for the origin of the fire:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon making known the situation of things as they stood previous
to the fire, it was suggested by some one that it might have
originated thus. I have before said that a great quantity of carpeting,
old and new, lay in the closet. An old Brussels carpet was
folded up and placed on the floor of the closet; on this lay a roll of
new Scotch carpet; and the whole was surmounted by a number of
empty paper hat-boxes. This being the state of things, and the
closet having no ceiling, it is very probable that during the heavy
rains which fell a short time previous, some of the water might
penetrate through the roof and wet the carpets. The rain was
succeeded by some of the hottest weather I ever remember. The
heat immediately under the slates would be very great; and we were
told that Brussels carpeting, which is composed partly of hemp and
partly of wool, if wet and afterwards exposed to heat, will ferment
and fire spontaneously, in the manner that hay sometimes does.
This opinion, upon inquiry, we found to be confirmed by experience.
A ship in the Mediterranean took fire from the fermentation of some
wet ropes stowed in the hold. A relation of ours, a builder, had his
premises partly destroyed by the fermentation of a quantity of hair
for plaster, placed under a shed. He knows this to have been the
cause, from the circumstance of the hair’s smoking having been
noticed the day preceding.”</p>

</div>

<p>He discusses the question of insurance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The question whether or not it is wise to insure, and to what
amount, appears to me a very difficult one. If a person’s property
be such that the loss of his house and furniture would not be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
ruinous injury, then it appears to me it would be absurd for him to
insure, because more than half the premium consists of duty to the
Government, and by becoming his own insurance broker he saves
that sum and the profit also. It appears to me also to be bad policy
to insure to a great amount, because by a strange arrangement in
all insurance offices, the sum paid for damage is not estimated,
as it ought to be, by considering what proportion the damage bears
to the whole value of the building, and paying the sufferer
the same fraction of the insurance. Thus, if a house be worth
£1,000, and is insured for £100, if the building is damaged to
the amount of £100, the office will pay the whole of that sum;
whereas I should say it ought to pay only the tenth part of £100—that
is, £10; for the rate of insurance upon a large sum is no less
than that upon a small one, and the probability of a house being
injured to the amount of £100 is greater than the chance of its
being injured to the amount of £200, still greater than the chance
of its sustaining an injury to the amount of £300, and so on.</p>

<p>“It was reasoning in this manner that induced me to insure for so
small a sum; but I forgot that our risk was greater than that of our
neighbours, in consequence of so many persons residing under the
same roof. For this reason, and because we should not be equally
well able to bear a second loss, we have now insured to a much
greater amount; but I am not sure that we were not right before, and
are mistaken now, because the circumstance of our having been unfortunate
is no proof of error, any more than the gaining a prize in the
lottery is a proof of the propriety of purchasing a ticket.</p>

<p>“Some people have very strange ideas about insurance from fire.
They appear to think that it actually prevents a fire taking place.
Birmingham furnishes a remarkable instance of an error of this kind.
The workhouse, which is the property of the whole town, is insured
in the Birmingham Fire Office, which is supported by a comparatively
small number of individuals. I wonder whether the company insures
its own office? Perhaps it does in another—or perhaps in its own!”</p>

</div>

<p>He fails, as it seems to me, to take into account that
freedom from daily anxiety which a man buys who
insures his property to its full value, or something not
much short of it. His eldest brother told me that, at
one time of his life, he himself was so much troubled
by the thought that if he died early he should leave his
young wife and children but ill provided for that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
health became affected, and his power of work was
lessened. His dread of poverty was, therefore, tending
to keep him poor. He insured his life heavily, and at
once regained his cheerfulness. He had paid, he
added, in his long life far more in premiums than his
children would ever receive back on his death. This
outlay, nevertheless, he looked upon as a real money
gain to him. It had given him freedom from care,
and this freedom had greatly helped to increase his
earnings.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1821, Rowland Hill and his next
brother, Arthur, crossed over to Ireland, to inspect the
Edgeworth-Town Assisting School. This curious
institution had been lately founded by Lovell Edgeworth,
the brother of Maria Edgeworth. On their
way the travellers passed through Manchester. There
for the first time they saw a whole town lighted by gas.
Between Liverpool and Dublin steamboats ran during
the summer months. None ventured as yet to cross
the winter seas. The fares were high—a guinea and
a-half for the passage. The sailing packets charged
but seven shillings; and it was in one of them that the
two brothers crossed over. On landing they had to
undergo the Custom House examination, as Import
Duties were still kept up between the two islands.
Two packets arrived almost at the same time, but
there was only one officer to examine all the baggage.
There were fees to pay; and overcharge was rendered
easy by the difference that still subsisted between
English and Irish money.</p>

<p>During their stay in Dublin they drove out with an
Irish barrister to see the Dargle. “We found,” wrote
the younger of the two brothers—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A line of bushes laid across the road into the grounds, and were
told by men working on the spot that we could not pass, the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
being under preparation for the King’s visit. Had we been alone we
should have either turned back or tried the power of a bribe; but
our Irish friend knew better; and after one or two cajoling phrases,
which moved not very much, proceeded to ‘damn the King!’ The
effect was complete, a gap being at once made, through which we
passed, while one of the men remarked that others had applied,
speaking of the King in high terms, but all those had been turned
back.”</p>

</div>

<p>One evening they saw the general departure of the
mails for the provinces. They expected, as a matter of
course, to find the guard of each coach armed, as in
England, with a blunderbuss; but they found that he
carried, in addition, a sword and pistols, while some of
the coaches had two guards, and others even three.
They left Dublin for Edgeworth-Town on a Sunday
morning. For the first time in their life they heard
bells rung from churches that did not belong to the
Establishment.</p>

<p>Rowland Hill’s Journal contains an interesting account
of this tour:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the road to Edgeworth-Town we were struck with the
miserable state of the poor Irish. Many live in huts without
either window or chimney, the door serving every purpose of ingression
and of egression. The poor women and children were
generally without shoes and stockings; the men, however, almost
always wear both, and even in the midst of summer appear dressed
in great coats. Though Sunday, we saw many parties dancing in
the roads and fields, the men in their great coats, and carts and
wagons passed along apparently as much as on any other day.
Every time the coach stopped it was surrounded by beggars,
apparently in the lowest possible state of misery.</p>

<p>“With a few exceptions, everything appears to be neglected.
The land is miserably cultivated, and worse fenced, and the houses
seem falling into ruin. You see gates with one hinge, and no
fastening, tied up by means of ropes or haybands; windows reduced
from a proper size to a single pane of glass, the remainder of the
window, as it was broken, having been stopped up with a flat stone,
a piece of wood, plaster, or a turf. In many places half the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
are in a state of ruin, and quite uninhabited. We learned that many
had been reduced to this state at the time of the riots.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Edgeworth-Town they lodged in the best inn of
which the place could boast. Nevertheless under the
bed they found put away a store of old shoes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After breakfast we went with Mr. Edgeworth to see his school. It
consists of about 160 boys, of all classes, from the sons of beggars to
the children of some of the most wealthy men in the neighbourhood.
They are classed without any distinction but that of merit, and to
destroy every difference in appearance, all the boys wore pinafores as
a kind of uniform. Out of school, however, some distinction is
made. The sons of gentlemen and respectable tradesmen have a
separate playground, and the boarders are divided among two or
three houses, according to their rank in society.</p>

<p>“About three-fourths of the boys had neither shoes nor stockings,
but they all appeared clean, happy, and contented.</p>

<p>“The plan of the school in some measure resembles the Lancasterian,
only that Mr. Edgeworth accomplishes much more than I
have ever seen done in a Lancasterian school. Every boy pays a little
for his education—viz., from 1<i>d.</i> to 5<i>d.</i> per week, according to his
circumstances. Mr. Edgeworth has a nursery of four or five acres, in
which the poor boys are allowed to work, in order to enable them to
pay for their education, for the washing of their pinafores, &amp;c.
There are two masters with salaries, one of whom has the general
superintendence of the school in Mr. Edgeworth’s absence, the other
teaches the classics. The weekly payments of the boys defray every
expense of the establishment, except the rent, within about a
hundred a year. The boarders pay the masters of the houses at
which they lodge for all expenses attending their maintenance.”</p>

</div>

<p>So eager were some of the boys to earn money by
working over-time, that Mr. Edgeworth was forced to
limit the hours of this kind of labour. A penalty was
fixed for any one who should venture to begin work
before the appointed time. Shortly before the arrival
of the two visitors, a boy had been found on a summer
morning hard at work as early as two o’clock. He
was saving up money to buy his mother a garment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which she stood greatly in need. Not only was the
breach of rule forgiven, but high honour was done to
the young offender. “The mode taken was characteristic
alike of man and country. When the required
sum was made up, and the garment purchased, this
being hung from the top of a pole, was borne in
triumph through the single street of the town, all the
boys marching in procession, with their landlord at
their head.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The boys, as far as we could ascertain in the course of a week’s
close inspection, are exceedingly orderly, attentive, and well behaved.
Mr. Edgeworth states that he finds the children of the peasantry
much more docile than those of gentlemen, and the English more
tractable than the Irish.</p>

<p>“The hay-harvest was now about, and the boys spent considerable
part of the day in the park making the hay. They worked in
classes, under the direction of monitors, and proceeded with the
utmost order and regularity; they very soon turned the grass of
several acres.</p>

<p>“Mr. Edgeworth spends a good deal of time in joking with his
boys. We saw him act before them the drunken, idle, low, but
shrewd Irishman, and many other characters for the instruction and
entertainment of his boys. They laugh with him, and, for the time,
master and scholars appear to be on the most familiar terms.</p>

<p>“On Wednesday we dined at Mr. Edgeworth’s house: there is
something highly fascinating in the company of celebrated people.
In conversing with Miss Edgeworth, I felt that I was renewing, as
it were, an old acquaintance; for who is there to whom she is
altogether unknown? I must acknowledge, however, that my
introduction to her was not made without some trepidation on my
part, but so kind, so unassuming is her manner, that in a very short
time I felt almost entirely at my ease in her company. I could not,
however, quite rid myself of the feeling that I was in the company of
one who had shown by her works that she could detect, and that she
noticed every little symptom of weakness which to a common eye
might pass unobserved. I was uneasy lest she should discover the
defects in my education before I could take an opportunity of
alluding to them, as is my custom in similar cases. Miss Edgeworth
is a short, sprightly woman, without any of the affectation of politeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
but with much that is real. One is apt to suppose that a
person of celebrity must always appear as though a high character
was to be supported; there is nothing of this kind about
Miss Edgeworth; she is exceedingly lively, and even playful in her
manner, and seems to have not the slightest objection to a good
joke.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I still esteem it,” writes the surviving brother,
“one of the greatest honours of my life to have sat
next to her at dinner by her own desire. To me, and
doubtless to my brother Rowland also, the interview
with this admirable woman savoured of romance. As
an abstraction, she had long been to every member of
our family an object of respect amounting to reverence.
Her works had been to us a source of delight, of instruction,
of purity, and of elevation, but herself
seemed indefinitely removed, and we could hardly
believe that we were now actually in her presence,
and admitted to friendly intercourse.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On Saturday I gave Mr. Edgeworth some parts of the rough draft
of ‘Public Education’ to read, which I had taken with me to
Ireland. He desired one of his monitors to take it to his house,
and leave it in his bedchamber, stating that he always lay in bed
till the middle of the day on Sunday, and that he could read it
before he arose in the morning.</p>

<p>“On Sunday morning, after our return from church, Mr. Edgeworth
sent to request our attendance at his school. We found the
boys all drawn up in divisions, and several gentlemen from the
neighbourhood were present. We joined Mr. Edgeworth, who stood
on a kind of stage formed by the stairs. He began a speech to his
boys on the subject of the papers which I had lent him to read, in
which he spoke in the most extravagant terms of what he had read.
He was sure that we had carried the science of education to a
perfection never before aimed at; he considered himself highly
flattered by our visit to his school, but felt ashamed that we had
not been better repaid for our trouble. He hoped we would allow
him to return the visit, as he was sure nothing would delight him
so much as a complete knowledge of our plans.</p>

<p>“After he had concluded, he requested that I would honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
state my opinions respecting his school, and he insisted on my
finding fault with something or other. I now felt the convenience
of having been practised at extemporaneous speaking: for called
upon as I was to address a great number of individuals, without any
previous notice or opportunity of arranging and collecting my
thoughts, and immediately after Mr. Edgeworth had spoken in the
highest terms of a work which, till I afterwards undeceived him,
he considered as entirely my own production, and for which he
lauded my powers in an extravagant degree, I should not have been
able to utter a single connected sentence, had not former practice
rendered that easy which, without practice, is to some altogether
impossible.</p>

<p>“In the evening we dined at Mr. Edgeworth’s. On entering the
library we found Miss Edgeworth reading ‘Public Education.’ She
spoke of it in less extravagant but not in less pleasing terms than her
brother. She had read the greater part, and with the highest delight.
Upon her complimenting me as the author, I informed her that I had
written but a small part, and that my elder brother was the principal
author. She then spoke with less restraint of the merits of the book,
and said that it reflected the highest credit on the writer, whoever he
might be. That her praise was not the unmeaning stuff of common-place
compliment I am sure, for it was not uniform. She objected
to some parts, which she advised us to alter. She had made notes
with her pencil as she read the book, which she pointed out to us.
Most of her suggestions we have adopted; a few which did not meet
our views, after mature deliberation we have ventured to disregard.
One part of the work contains a compliment to Miss Edgeworth,
written, as I could not help telling her for my own credit, before we
had any intention of visiting Ireland. It is in speaking of our
obligations to her as the author of so many excellent tales for children.
The name of her father had been coupled with hers, but was afterwards
crossed out from the belief that the tales were almost entirely
her own production. This she had noticed, and, with tears in her
eyes, requested that his name might be restored, stating that he had
materially assisted her in all her productions, and that she wished
never to be considered separately from him....</p>

<p>“I cannot describe the restless activity of Mr. Edgeworth. This
evening he displayed more character than I had before had an
opportunity of observing. Let it be remembered that this was
Sunday evening.</p>

<p>“We did not sit down to dinner till after seven o’clock. So long
as the ladies remained in the room Mr. Edgeworth kept some curb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
on his spirits. He was the complete gentleman, behaving with the
greatest respect towards his female relations, and, indeed, towards
every one at the table. As soon as the barbarous custom now in
vogue had driven the ladies to the drawing-room, Mr. Edgeworth
invited us to draw our chairs together. The butler was ordered to
bring some bottles of a particular claret, which he told us was better
than nectar. A toast was proposed, and we proceeded to the
business of the evening, Mr. Edgeworth for some time watching
very carefully to see there was no unnecessary display of ‘daylight.’
Between every toast, Mr. E. spoke in the most extravagant terms
of our book; and ‘Hazelwood School,’ ‘Mr. Hill and family,’ ‘The
author of the book,’ &amp;c., were toasted with all due solemnity.
We did not fail to return thanks, and to propose ‘The Edgeworth-Town
Assisting School,’ ‘Miss Edgeworth,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>“I must remark that in the morning he had asked me many
questions respecting our band, and had expressed to his boys his
earnest wish that a band should be formed in his school. Some
of the boys, it was stated, could already play a little upon the flute.
Mr. Edgeworth desired them to perfect themselves with all possible
despatch.</p>

<p>“In the midst of our jollification, as we sat with the windows open,
we heard two flutes playing a quick tune in the town. Mr. Edgeworth
was delighted with this, and immediately sent one of his servants to
fetch the players, whoever they might be. The man soon returned
with two of the scholars, who had been parading up and down the
street without shoes and stockings, and marching to their own music.
We immediately adjourned to a kind of conservatory, into which
the dining-room opened, where, after giving us another tune, the boys
joined us in drinking ‘Success to the band.’ ... Delighted with
every one, and with himself in particular, Mr. Edgeworth got into
the most playful humour. Sometimes, after a toast, he directed
we should join hands all round, then cross them, &amp;c....
At about midnight, he proposed that we should go to the school-house,
and see how things went on there. He opened a back
door, which let us at once into the street. The key of this door
he always kept about him, as he said, that he might go out and
inspect the state of the town at any hour of the night without
disturbing his family. This he frequently does, going into people’s
houses in disguise,—in imitation, I suppose, of the hero of the
Arabian tales. The butler was sent forward to call up O’Brien, the
classical teacher of the school, and Steele, one of the head monitors.
He was cautioned, at the same time, not to forget the good things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
which were under his care.... Steele, who, though a young
man of genteel appearance, is the son of a poor bricklayer, sallied
forth from a small cottage, and met us in the street. Both he and
O’Brien had been in bed. Mr. Edgeworth, like most men who are
occasionally very familiar with their inferiors, is very tenacious of his
rank and authority. Poor Steele was desired to relate a story—of
which the length very far exceeded the interest—about a silver
trowel which had been presented by Mr. Edgeworth to Steele’s
father, on account of his having had the honour to open the family
vault at the time of the death of the late Mr. Edgeworth.
The young man, as was natural enough when we consider that he
had been called out of a warm bed, and was now standing in the
street at midnight, began his relation with his head covered. Mr.
Edgeworth immediately ordered him to take off his hat, and even
made him put it on the ground.</p>

<p>“At the school-house, after carefully satisfying ourselves that all
the boys were safely roosted, we proceeded much in the same
manner as at Mr. Edgeworth’s house. O’Brien and Steele were
asked by him if they knew any good songs, and they accordingly
favoured us with some of their best.</p>

<p>“Shortly after, Mr. Edgeworth, as though a thought had suddenly
struck him, cried out that he should uncommonly like a beefsteak.
Most of us agreed that it would be a good thing; but Arthur, who
had been rather fidgetty most of the evening, could stand it no
longer, and accordingly made good his retreat to the inn. For my
own part, I cannot say that I receive the least true pleasure from
parties like this; but, as every one must occasionally join in them,
I think it best to make oneself as comfortable as possible under
all the circumstances, and not to attempt to swim against the stream.</p>

<p>“The mistress of the house, who I afterwards learned had been in
bed, was now summoned, and questioned as to the possibility of
satisfying our wishes. Fortunately she was provided with the means,
and at about two o’clock we sat down to a beefsteak supper. After
supper, Mr. Edgeworth commenced an oration in praise of his
butler’s grandmother, who had been remarkable for many good
qualities. The glasses were filled, the butler was furnished with one,
and with the utmost solemnity we drank to the memory of the
worthy grandmother....</p>

<p>“The next day we took our leave of the Edgeworths. Miss Edgeworth
had now read the whole of the book. She spoke of its
excellences in the same terms as before, but she objected to some
parts of our plan. She is afraid that the republicanism of the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
may be alarming, and advises that this part should be made less
prominent. She says she is afraid that parents will dread the
republican spirit which our system must infuse among the boys. I
think she has too much good sense to think this an evil in itself—indeed,
she spoke of it only as a matter of prudence as regards
ourselves. She, perhaps, may be right, but I think that we may
venture; because, in the first place, the republican tendency of our
plans is very far from obvious, and there are very few Miss Edgeworths
to find it out. And again, I think people are now beginning
to be a little enlightened on the subject, and that we shall soon
be on the popular side of the question, even with that class which
it is our interest to please.”</p>

</div>

<p>On their way back to Dublin, the travellers overheard
two Irishmen discussing the career of Napoleon,
tidings of whose death had lately arrived. One of them
maintained that the failure of his Russian campaign
was altogether due to a premature setting-in of the
monsoons. The other modestly remarked that he
had always understood that these winds were known
only on the Indian Ocean. “Yes,” replied the first;
“but that year they blew a <i>tremendious</i> long way
inland, carrying with them prodigious cold.”</p>

<p>The brothers took the steam-packet from Dublin
to Holyhead. “The captain told them that his
company intended to attempt running it throughout
the next winter; and cautiously remarked that he
thought in a storm a steamer might even have
some advantages over a sailing-vessel.”</p>

<p>In the summer of the following year (1822),
Rowland Hill again visited the Isle of Wight,
accompanied by two of his younger brothers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While in the Isle of Wight, I visited a cave in the side of an
immensely high cliff. This cave is called the Hermit’s Hole.
The only road to it is along a narrow path leading from the top
of the cliff. This path is steep and narrow, and the descent is
somewhat dangerous, as a slip would inevitably precipitate a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
down the cliff, a height of about seven hundred feet, into the sea
which roars below. Travellers in the Isle of Wight speak in strange
terms of this cave. One says ‘the mere thought of such an
adventure (that of visiting the cave) is enough to shake the strongest
nerves;’ and he recommends no one to venture, as ‘the path is so
narrow that it is impossible to turn round, consequently a person
who should set out must go all the way.’ I believe I am naturally
cowardly. I have, however, I hope educated myself to face danger
as well as most men. I therefore feel a pleasure and an interest in
voluntarily putting my courage to the test, and I am proud when
I find I can do that which other people pronounce to be difficult.
Arthur would not venture to the edge of the cliff; but, after taking
off my coat, I proceeded down the path, followed by Frederic. At
first the path is protected by a projecting rock, which forms a kind of
breastwork on the sea side, but after a few yards there is no protection
whatever. I found the path better than I had expected; but
it is very steep and narrow, and, besides slanting in length towards
the cave, has a side slant towards the sea. There were several loose
stones upon it, which made the danger so much the greater; some of
these upon the least touch fell into the sea. It was with some
difficulty I overcame an involuntary feeling of the necessity of
leaping after them. The cave has nothing in itself to repay the
danger of reaching it: the whole pleasure, indeed, consists in the
danger overcome. Notwithstanding the accounts given by travellers,
I turned back two or three times to see for Frederic. He ventured
the greater part of the way; but when he came to a place where the
path turned round a projecting part of the cliff, his courage failed
him, and he hurried back. I must confess, however, that he
accomplished more than I could have done at his age. I think
the path was about twenty yards in length.”</p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1822 “Public Education” was
published. Every effort had been made to work up
the school to a high degree of excellence. “I am
perfectly aware,” Rowland Hill wrote, “that much
must be done before our school is fully prepared to
stand the minute, and, perhaps, in many cases, invidious
inspection which will take place in consequence
of our inviting attention. I am also convinced of the
necessity of making very vigorous improvements in
my own mind. I hope I have already done much,
and I am determined to accomplish more.” The
Exhibition, or Speech-day, of June, 1822, had been a
great success. “It was,” old Mr. Hill wrote to his
eldest son, “a night of triumphant excellence.” Under
the date of August 4th, 1822, Rowland Hill records in
his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have every reason at present to be pleased with the reception
the book has met with. It has not yet received much attention from
reviewers. An article has, it is true, appeared in the ‘Monthly
Magazine,’ speaking of it in terms of the highest praise, and it has
been noticed in terms of general commendation in several of the
newspapers; but I allude chiefly to the private expression of the
opinions of people of the highest literary rank The book appears to
interest its readers in a very unusual manner. It seems to be
spreading a kind of education mania in the world.... Jeremy
Bentham is a man who will not be forgotten in the world; though
neglected by a great part of his countrymen, he is held in the highest
esteem by the enlightened and honest.... To him, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
author of a work on education, and as a man of the greatest influence,
Matthew presented a copy of our book. A short time after he received
an invitation to dine with Mr. Bentham. He was received in the
most flattering manner. Mr. Bentham informed him that, when he
first saw the book, disgusted as he had often been by the vague
generalities of treatises on education, he threw it aside without
looking into it. Shortly after, however, he opened the book, with
very slight hopes of discovering anything worth reading. His
attention was very soon fixed; he gave it to his reader, a young
man of seventeen, who, to use Mr. Bentham’s own phrase, went
‘chuckling all the way through it.’ Mr. Bentham was so delighted
with the work that he kept it on a little shelf constantly within
reach, and opened it many times during dinner.”</p>

</div>

<p>Bentham sent a friend to inspect the school. “He
certainly did not neglect his duty, for he would take
nothing on credit. Such inspections as these, however,
far from displeasing us, are exactly what we want.”</p>

<p>So favourable was the inspector’s report, that
Bentham placed two Greeks at Hazelwood at his own
expense. He circulated the Magazine that the boys
published among his friends, and even sent a contribution
to its pages in a letter franked by Joseph
Hume:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Queen’s Square Place, Westminster,<br />
“April 11th, 1823.</p>

<p>“Proposed for the ‘Hazelwood Magazine,’ with Mr. Bentham’s
love to the good boys thereof, that they may consider which of the
two modes of discipline is preferable.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Extract from the</i> <span class="smcap">Morning Chronicle</span>, <i>April 11th, 1823</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">An active Schoolmaster.</span>—According to the ‘German Pedagogic
Magazine,’ vol. 3, p. 407, died lately in Spain, a schoolmaster
who for fifty-one years had superintended a large institution with old-fashioned
severity. From an average inferred by means of recorded
observations, one of the ushers had calculated that in the course of
his exertions he had given 911,500 canings, 124,000 floggings,
209,000 custodes, 136,000 tips with the ruler, and 22,700 tasks to
get by heart. It was further calculated that he made 700 boys stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
on peas, 600 kneel on a sharp edge of wood, 5,000 wear the fool’s cap,
and 1,700 hold the rod. How vast the quantity of human misery
inflicted by a single perverse educator.’—<i>Whitehaven Gazette.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Bentham wrote to Dr. Parr “in high terms of the
system, saying that it had caused him to throw aside
all he had done himself.” He kept up his interest in
the school, and some years later, in company with
Mrs. Grote, at whose house he was staying, visited
Rowland Hill at Bruce Castle. “Mr. Bentham,” he
wrote on September 15th, 1827, “paid us a visit on
Wednesday, and went away highly delighted. I never
saw him in such spirits before. It is the first time
he has left his home since his return from Paris (in
1825).” The fame of Hazelwood rapidly spread.
The Greek Committee placed two young Greeks in
the school:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His Excellency the Tripolitan Ambassador has informed us that
he has sent to Tripoli for six young Africans, and the Algerine
Ambassador, not to be outdone by his piratical brother, has sent for
a dozen from Algiers. The Persian Ambassador also thinks it would
be much to the advantage of the monarchy he represents to put a
few persons under our guidance. If these worthies should come, we
must look out for a Mosque.”</p>

</div>

<p>“We will rejoice over them,” wrote old Mr. Hill
to his son, “when winds and seas have wafted them to
port. Think not this proceeds from incredulity. So
much good fortune as to be the means of sending
civilization, and of darting one ray of liberty upon the
wilds of Africa, seems too much to hope for.”</p>

<p>Wilberforce, the venerable champion of negro
emancipation, and Grote, the future historian of
Greece, went to Birmingham to inspect the school.
Grote heard the boys construe Homer. Even at that
time enough was known of his studies in Greek to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
make the young master who was taking the class feel
not a little nervous. Two of Mrs. Grote’s nephews
were removed from Eton and placed at Hazelwood.
Five years later Grote, writing to Rowland Hill to
introduce a friend, says, “I have taken the liberty of
mentioning to him the high opinion which I entertain
of the Hazelwood system.” The elder of the two
nephews on leaving Cambridge went over to Stockholm
as a kind of apostle of the new learning.
“Public Education” had been translated into Swedish
by Count Frölich, and a company was formed in
Sweden to found a “Hillian School.” Professor Säve,
of the University of Upsala, stayed a month at Hazelwood,
carefully studying the system. But even a
Professor could not master such a system in a month,
and aid was called for from England. The young
Cambridge man offered himself as a volunteer in the
great cause. He went over to Stockholm, and for
many a year helped to keep the faith pure and undefiled
in the <i>Hillska Skola</i>.</p>

<p>Lord John Russell sent Dr. Maltby to inspect the
school, and Dr. Maltby some years later on, when
Bishop of Durham, gave out the prizes. “The number
of visitors here,” wrote Mr. M. D. Hill when on a
visit to his father’s house, “is immense. It is quite a
nuisance. They sometimes have three or four parties
at a time, and not a day passes without some.” The
Marquis of Lansdowne, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord
Auckland, Lord Kinnaird, Sir George Napier, Sir
George Pollock, Brougham, De Quincey, Roscoe,
Malthus, Joseph Hume, Nassau Senior, Robert
Owen, W. J. Fox, Basil Hall, Babbage, and
Lardner were all interested in Hazelwood, and not a
few of them sent pupils there. Some of them even
wished to reform the constitution. “We have had, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the whole,” wrote old Mr. Hill to his son, “a pleasant
interview with Mr. Hume and Dr. Gilchrist. They
wish to set us right in two important particulars.
First—That we should compel all to remain when the
Committee comes to be chosen. Second—That the
votes be all secret on that and all other occasions.
We are quite obstinate on both questions, and, in
conformity with usage, persist in old ways. You will
be most highly amused with the honourable gentleman’s
penetrative inspection, when it shall become safe
to tell all. He is, however, a right good fellow. The
Doctor set out with a grammatical examination, but
presently delapsed into an etymological disquisition
and lecture, exquisitely amusing and, as I maintain,
highly instructive.” In January, 1825, “Public Education”
was criticised in the “Edinburgh Review,”
and criticised in the most friendly spirit. The
“London Magazine” followed a year later with a
long, and a still more friendly, article by De Quincey.
M. Jullien, the editor of the “Revue Encyclopédique,”
himself inspected the school, and then published
in his Review an article on the book. The ex-President
of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, who
was at that time organising the University of Virginia,
sent for the work. Mr. Bowring wrote to say that he
had himself sent out a copy to the President of Haiti.
Many pupils were sent to Hazelwood from abroad,
chiefly from the newly-founded Republics of South
America. The school almost at one bound sprang
into fame. “It was a celebrity,” Rowland Hill wrote
in his old age “which I now think was excessive, and
which was followed in some instances by disappointment.”
Yet at the time it might well have seemed to
the young man that his early dreams were not the
children of an idle brain. He might well have thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that he had already done much towards rendering his
name illustrious in after ages.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In his letters, however,
I find few signs of triumph. In his Journal,
unfortunately, a break of many years begins about this
time. He had begun to keep it for the sake of practice
in composition, and his lesson was now learnt. “I
can now employ my time to greater advantage, and I
rather grudge the little attention which I still devote
to my history.”</p>

<p>His health was breaking down under his heavy
labour. Writing to his eldest brother a fortnight
after the beginning of the summer holidays of 1822,
he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You complain, and with justice, that I do not write to you. To
tell the truth, since the holidays commenced I have done nothing at
all. I can scarcely say how the time has passed; all I know is that
it is gone. The exertions previous to the exhibition were succeeded
by a languor of which I have not yet been able to rid myself.
It was not my intention to have left home these holidays, for there
is much that I wish to do, but every one tells me I am thin and
pale.... Arthur and Frederic are much in the same predicament
with myself.”</p>

</div>

<p>He had much wanted, he said, to go to Scotland,
with letters of introduction to the officer who was
conducting the trigonometrical survey. Owen’s establishment
at New Lanark had also “a strong magnetic
influence.” A year later (1823) he again excuses his
neglect to write to his brother. “Writing a letter
always costs me a headache.” He had just enjoyed a
six weeks’ tour through the north of England and
Scotland:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Through Westmoreland and Cumberland I of course walked, and
never spent four days more pleasantly than in viewing the delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
scenery those counties afford. At New Lanark I was
received in the most hospitable manner by the Owens. I spent two
days and a-half there very pleasantly and profitably. In the management
of the children neither rewards nor punishments are employed.
The consequences are that the children appear very happy, very
healthy, many very intelligent, and many very inattentive and
disorderly; but when I consider that the children in the schools
are nearly all under ten years of age, and that what they are
taught is effected without any pain whatever being intentionally
inflicted, I cannot be sure that theirs is not the correct mode of
proceeding.”</p>

</div>

<p>During this tour he was free from pain nearly all
the time:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the very morning after my return the pain returned, and has
not yet left me, though it is not so bad as at first.... I am
cruelly disappointed to find that so much time and money
should have been expended to so little purpose, as it at present
appears.”</p>

</div>

<p>Three months later he describes his fear of a relapse
into “the maddening state of mind” from which he
had but lately escaped.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1824 he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot condense my efforts as I used to do. I am obliged to
take more time for everything.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few months later his brother Matthew writes to
him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am very glad to hear of your recovery. If I were you, I would
let the exhibition go to the Devil rather than overwork myself....
Depend upon it, you will never be paid either in fame or profit for
any exertion in that barren spot. Spare yourself for better times.”</p>

</div>

<p>When the summer holidays began, he took a trip to
Paris:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I visited one of the floating baths on the Seine, when, forgetful
of my weak state, I plunged at once into deep water. Immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the attendants hurried forward to my rescue with long, slender poles,
like boat-hooks, and were very angry, as though I had intended
suicide. And, in fact, I found that I was quite too weak to swim.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was in vain that his brother urged him to spare
himself. Whatever he put his hand to, he did with
all his might. A year later (September, 1825) he was
once more dangerously ill. “Mr. Hodgson,”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> his
father wrote, “prohibits all hints even about business.
He says that the serious aspect assumed by the
carbuncle is clearly the effect of mental excitation,
and that your brother’s is the first instance of such
a turn in a person under forty that has come under
his observation.... It is a sad thing to be
paralysed at the instant of high water in our affairs.
Disappointment is, however, no new thing to us, and
patience may work a retrieval, as it has done in times
past.”</p>

<p>Two days later he again writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though it were vain to disguise the fears which intrude themselves
on your mother’s mind and my own, still we have Mr.
Hodgson’s assurance that all will go well, provided the dear boy’s
mind can be kept from painful excitement.... Mr. Hodgson
has told your mother that, as soon as Rowland recovers, he shall
strongly advise him, as a medical friend, to abandon any plan that
shall demand unusual energy. These, my dear boy, are damping
suggestions. My fear is that they will be unavailing, and that a
life so truly valuable will be lost in splendid but abortive efforts.”</p>

</div>

<p>The severe operations which he had to undergo he
bore with the utmost fortitude. During the worst of
them he never uttered a sound, but merely said when
it was over, “Come, that’s no trifle.” Bodily pain at
all times of his life he endured with silent patience.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that there was no sense of failure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
his plans to heighten his illness. He had none of
that misery to encounter which, as he had written,
would come upon him should Hazelwood not succeed.
His success seemed complete. In 1819 the new
school-house had opened with sixty-six pupils. Year
after year for seven years the numbers steadily rose
till, by 1826, there were 150. Rugby did not at
that time number so many. When he was lying
on his sick-bed his father wrote—“Applications (for
admittance) are almost become a source of anxiety,
unless they were made pleasant by a greater portion
of health and strength to meet them.” I have been
told by one who was then living in Birmingham
that so great for a time was the eagerness to get
boys into Hazelwood that, when the school was full,
strangers often sought the advocacy of a common
friend, in the hope of still securing a place for their
son. The very thoroughness of the success was a
great misfortune. The steady growth of the new
school during its first few years was due to its real
merits. The two youngest sons had joined their elder
brothers in the management, and for some years there
were four of them all working harmoniously together,
and with the greatest energy. “Public Education”
did not at first rapidly swell the numbers. But when
Jeffrey in the “Edinburgh Review,” and De Quincey
in the “London Magazine,” both blew a loud blast
in its praise, then the tide of prosperity set in with
far too sudden and too full a flood. The heads
of the young schoolmasters were by no means turned
by their success. They found themselves confronted
with fresh difficulties. Rowland Hill had before this
become painfully aware of his own shortcomings.
But these were brought more than ever home to him
by his very success, for it lifted him at once into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
higher class of society. Men of rank and men of
learning sent their children to be educated at Hazelwood.
The expectations that “Public Education”
raised were undoubtedly too high. The young authors
wrote with thorough honesty. But they were writing
about their own inventions and their own schemes;
and, like all other inventors and schemers, they had a
parental fondness for the offspring of their own brains.
The rapid increase in the number of pupils was, moreover,
as it always must be, a great source of danger
to the discipline. In any school it is always a very
hazardous time when the proportion of new boys is
large. But in such a school as Hazelwood, with its
complicated system of self-government, the hazard must
have been unusually great. Out of 117 boys, with
whom the school opened in January, 1825, only sixty-three
had been in it more than seven months. At
the very time, therefore, when Rowland Hill might
with good reason have looked to enjoy some rest
from his prolonged toil, a fresh strain was thrown
upon him. It is not wonderful that he sank under it
for a time, almost broken, as it seemed, in health and
spirits.</p>

<p>In the midst of his hard work, a few months before
the second of the two illnesses, he had been suddenly
called upon to face a new difficulty. He had been
bent on founding a great school, which should serve as
a kind of model to the whole country. “I had refrained
from writing to you,” he wrote to his eldest
brother, when he was regaining his strength, “because
I knew it to be important to my speedy recovery to
keep down as much as possible all those associations
connected with the little school, and with the great
school, which so uniformly arise in my mind whenever
I write to you, let the subject be what it may.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Even so early as the year 1820 he had recorded in
his Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All our plans are necessarily calculated for great numbers, and I
contend that, where the strength of the teachers is proportionate, a
school cannot be too numerous. If we had 500 instead of 70 boys,
I would make this place a Paradise. Till we have some such
number, the effects of our system, great as they have already been,
cannot be justly appreciated. I have some hopes that in time we may
be able to explode the foolish ideas that private education and
limited numbers are desirable.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few years later he began to see that it was not in
a suburb of Birmingham that even he could make a
Paradise. He saw that to carry out his plans the day
must come when he should move to the neighbourhood
of London. There was still much, he felt, to be done
before he should be ready to take this step. But from
a clear sky there came a clap of thunder. He was
suddenly filled with alarm lest his plans should be
forestalled. He was startled to learn that Bentham
had one day said to Matthew Hill, “I have been
thinking whether, if a sucker were taken from your
Hazelwood tree and planted near London, it would
grow.” In February, 1825, Matthew wrote that
Brougham had just told him that he, John Smith,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
and James Mill had resolved to found a school
at London on the Hazelwood plan immediately.
“Brougham has some money in hand, and J. Smith
has offered to find the rest at four per cent.
Brougham says that Burdett, Hobhouse, and Mill
are strongly in favour of Hazelwood.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Rowland Hill
was not a little alarmed at the news, and with some
reason, too. “Will it not be well,” he wrote back to
his brother, “to inform Brougham that we have it in
contemplation to establish a metropolitan school ourselves?
If he knows this already, I think his conduct
is very strange.” The brothers were not long in
coming to a decision. They resolved to act upon
Bentham’s thought with all speed, and plant near
London a sucker from the Hazelwood tree.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Rowland had somewhat recovered his
strength, he began to explore the country round
London, in the quest after a suitable house. The
search was a long one. “I have,” he wrote in March,
1826, “with the exception of a small district which I
am just going to explore, and a part of Essex, examined
every great road from London.” At length his efforts
were crowned with success. In the old mansion which
had for ages borne the name of Bruce Castle, standing
in the beautiful fragment of what once had been a
wide park, he found a home for his new school. He
had always been keenly alive to the charms both of
scenery and antiquity. Here he found the two happily
combined. The park, indeed, was but small, yet so
thick was the foliage of the stately trees, and so
luxuriant the undergrowth of the shrubberies, that
its boundaries failed to catch the eye. High overhead
the rooks, from time immemorial, had had their
homes in the lofty elms. The wood-pigeons built on
the topmost branches of a noble cedar of Lebanon,
and the cuckoo, with his two-fold shout, never forgot
there the return of spring. The kingfisher has been
seen perching on a branch that overhung the pool in
which the water-hen has reared her young. Hard by
the main building stood an ancient tower, where the
owls, year after year, made their nest—a tower which
was standing when Elizabeth visited the mansion, and
when Henry VIII. met there his sister, Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Margaret of Scotland. Ancient though it is, it does
not go back to days when both the house and manor
took their name from their owner, the father of King
Robert Bruce. The foundations of earlier buildings
have been found deep beneath the lawn. On two of
the bricks of the house there can still be read the first
letters of names which were carved, as the date tells,
when a Stuart was King in England. Through a
narrow gate in the western boundary of the park, the
path leads, across a quiet lane, into the churchyard.
Here, as tradition told, the wall had been broken down
when the last of the Lords Coleraine died, who had
once owned the manor, and through the gap the body
had been carried to its resting-place. Close by this little
gate rose a graceful Lombardy poplar to the height
of 100 feet—a landmark to all the country round.
Through the trees, when winter had stripped them of
their leaves, was seen from the windows of the Castle
an ancient church-tower of singular beauty: ivy had
covered it to the coping-stone with the growth of full
two hundred years. When the foliage of summer hid
it from the view, nevertheless it made its presence
known by a peal of bells famous for their sweetness.
The sound of the summoning bell might well inspire
lofty thoughts and high aims, for it had once hung in
the Citadel of Quebec, and had rung out the alarm
when Wolfe stormed the heights of Abraham. The
bells still remain, but the ivy has yielded to the ruthless
hand of an ignorant restorer. The tower is ivy-mantled
no more; and the graceful work of two long
centuries has been in a moment wantonly cast away.</p>

<p>This beautiful home was doubly endeared to Rowland
Hill, for here he brought his bride, and here he
spent the first six years of his wedded life. In the
same summer that he left Hazelwood he had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the playmate of his childhood. His affection for her
had grown with his growth, and had never for a
moment wavered. He had long loved her with the
deep but quiet love of a strong nature. He was no
Orlando to character his thoughts on the barks of
trees. Even to his Journal, though he kept it hidden
from every eye but his own, he never entrusted his
secret. Two years before he kept his golden wedding-day
he noticed, it would seem, this silence so uncommon
in a lover. “From motives of delicacy,” he
noted down, “I avoided in my Journal all mention of
my early attachment to C——.” If his early records
were silent in her praise, yet, when he came to write
the history of the great work of his life, he spoke out
with no uncertain accents. “I cannot record my
marriage,” he wrote, “without adding that my dear
wife’s help in my subsequent toils, and not least in
those best known to the public, was important, perhaps
essential, to their success.” An old-fashioned friend
of his family, who knew well how hard she had
laboured in helping her husband in his great work,
on hearing some one say that Mr. Rowland Hill
was the Father of Penny Postage, quaintly remarked,
“Then I know who was its Mother. It was his
wife.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="LIFE_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>The family group at Hazelwood, of which Rowland
Hill had for many years formed the central figure,
began with his settlement at Bruce Castle to break up.
It had from time to time been lessened by the marriage
of a child; nevertheless, four sons and a daughter had
been left, who lived year after year under their parents’
roof in harmony and with great singleness of heart.
“In our course through life,” he said in a passage
which I once more quote, “from the beginning to the
present hour, each one of us has been always ready to
help the others to the best of his power; and no one
has failed to call for such assistance again and again.”
How great was the aid that he afforded his brothers,
they gratefully acknowledged. One of them, writing
to him a few years after he had left Hazelwood,
said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No one, I am sure, can forget for many hours together that the
family owes much more to you than to any other member—that, in
fact, the sacrifices you have made, and the energy and talent you
have brought to bear on its advancement ought to obtain for you the
constant acknowledgments and gratitude of all. Arthur and I
frequently avow this in our private conversation. I think, too, you
show beyond dispute that you have been more persevering than most
of us in your pursuits, even though you were not allowed to choose
your profession.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the time of their tribulation and in the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their wealth, the brothers were equally united. Many
years they had passed in breathing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The keen, the wholesome air of poverty;</div>
<div class="verse">And drinking from the well of homely life.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not a few years had they now enjoyed of prosperity.
But prosperity had no power to snap that bond which
had been knitted in adversity. “The whole family
participated in my joy,” wrote Rowland, when, as a
boy of thirteen, he won the drawing prize. Throughout
life, every prize that he won—every prize that any
of them won—was a matter of rejoicing to all. “The
spirit of co-operation was recommended to us,” the
brothers wrote, “by our parents—during their lives and
on their death-beds.” An instance of this may be seen
in the following letter, written to Rowland Hill by his
father:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“<i>September 17, 1827.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,—This day thirty-five years ago I lost my beloved
brother Matthew. Dating this letter first brought into my mind
the recollection of the circumstance that this was the melancholy
anniversary, which is marked in my mind more than any other day
of the year. Nor have I a wish that such might not be the case.
To see my children united, as they are, in strong fraternal affection is
doubly delightful, as it so forcibly reminds me of that which subsisted
between my brother and myself to the moment of his death, and
which will remain with me till quenched by the corresponding event.
The sorrows of such feelings you know to be preferable to the joys of
anti-social gratifications.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this spirit they all steadily acted. I have come
across an old letter in which the eldest son wrote
to ask Rowland for his help in a matter of great
moment. It so happened that the request came at
a time when he could be but ill spared from his
school. He answered:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“As we cannot, from ignorance of many of the facts, judge how
far my going is important to your interests, I will state to you the
sacrifice on our part, and then leave the decision in your hands,
begging of you to determine the question with reference to the total
amount of advantage, and not caring whether the sacrifice is on our
side or yours.”</p>

</div>

<p>He states at length the difficulties under which he
himself lies; and thus concludes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You know us too well to suspect us of unwillingness to assist in
promoting your success in life. If the probable advantage to yourself,
and through you to the other members of the family, will, in
your opinion, outweigh the probable inconveniences which we may
sustain, pray say so without the slightest reserve, and I will meet you
at the time appointed.”</p>

</div>

<p>When he was first made a partner in the school, he
recorded in his Journal: “I do not know whether my
father intends to give me a share of the profits of the
business, and I shall say nothing about it myself till
he can better afford it.” It would seem that for the
next nine years he altogether forgot to say anything
about it, for it was not till the time of his marriage
that any division was made of the common stock.
The father and mother and the four sons who had
been concerned in the management of the school had
hitherto lived like the early Christians: “Neither said
any of them that aught of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things
common.” “I suppose,” writes one of the survivors
of this band of brothers, “when any one was about
to incur a larger expense than usual, as for a long
journey, he must have mentioned the matter to the
others, and so obtained at least a tacit consent; but
there was nothing formal in the matter, nor can I
remember a single discussion on the subject; for each
knowing the family necessities acted accordingly. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
any separate fund possessed by any single member I
have no recollection.” To hold property in common
for many years would generally put family concord to
a severe strain. To divide it might, perhaps, put it to
one still more severe. Happily in the division that
now took place the strain was not felt. The second
son, Edwin, who up to this time had had no share in
the school, was made arbitrator, and he apportioned
the common property, which was of no inconsiderable
amount, among his parents and his brothers. “I
have,” he wrote, “considered the property as having
been accumulated within the last twelve years, and I
have supposed that the efforts of each brother were
equally efficient at the same age. I suppose accumulation
to begin with the age of twenty years. The
value of the services of each I have assumed to increase
with the age of each, and in the proportion of
age.”</p>

<p>The brothers now drew up Articles of Partnership.
The two schools were to be managed as one business.
The parents retired, but their place was filled up by
the second son and his wife. The Twelfth Article of
Partnership was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From a consideration that it is far more important that each
claimant should receive enough money to enable him to defray the
reasonable expenses of his maintenance, clothing, &amp;c., than that
some should be accumulating property, whilst others might be
running in debt, it was determined that should the profits in any one
year ever fall so low as not to yield more than the estimated amount
of the necessary expenses of each claimant for that year, the proportions
recorded above shall no longer be observed, and the following
sums (which are considered as equivalent to such necessary
expenditure) shall be substituted in their stead.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “necessary expenditure of each claimant” was
calculated by the number of people whom he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
support. For each of the three unmarried brothers
it was fixed at the same amount. The two married
brothers were each to be allowed between two and
three times as much as a bachelor. If in any year
there were not profits enough made to supply even
the “necessary expenditure,” each claimant, nevertheless,
could draw upon the general fund for “the stated
sum.” In more years than one it happened that “the
total of profits arising from all sources did not equal
the expenses incurred in the maintenance of the
families.” The profits were then divided “according
to the plan provided to meet such a case, namely,
that each partner have a share proportioned to his
estimated reasonable expenses.” The more children
a partner had, the larger share he received. In this
arrangement there was, it must be allowed, something
not altogether in accordance with the principles laid
down by Mr. Malthus.</p>

<p>When, some years later, the school partnership was
dissolved, a plan for mutual insurance was at once
formed by Rowland Hill and the three other surviving
partners under the name of <i>The Family Fund</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To afford to each a security, to a certain extent, against future
suffering from poverty, and to secure to all such advantages of union
as are perfectly consistent with the non-existence of a partnership,
it is further agreed to form a fund, to be called the Family Fund, to
be applied to the relief of any of the undersigned, or their wives, or
their descendants, who, in the opinion of the Managers of the Fund,
may require such relief.</p>

<p>“The Managers of the Fund to consist of the survivors among
the undersigned, or such other persons as the Managers, for the time
being, may appoint in writing.</p>

<p>“The Managers to have the uncontrolled disposal of the Fund, as
regards both principal and interest.”</p>

</div>

<p>Each brother was to begin by contributing to the
fund a considerable sum of money, “and, further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
one-half of the surplus of his annual clear earnings
(exclusive of the proceeds of investments) over his
reasonable expenses.” The surplus earnings were
to be taken on a series of years. An estimate,
varying in each case, was adopted of the reasonable
expenses of each brother. While they considered it
expedient, they said, to leave themselves and their
successors unfettered in the management of the fund,
they, nevertheless, thought that it might be useful to
put on record some of their views. From these views
I extract the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That anyone possessing an interest in the Fund should be
considered as entitled to relief, if in circumstances much depressed
as compared with the others, though not in absolute poverty.</p>

<p>“That so long, however, as he is able, without great embarrassment,
to draw on his own capital, his claim to relief should not be admitted.</p>

<p>“That in determining the amount of relief, regard should be had to
the propriety or impropriety of the conduct which has led to its necessity.</p>

<p>“That at occasional annual meetings,—say once in ten years,—it
is desirable to consider whether it might not be expedient to close
the Family Fund account, and divide the whole among the undersigned,
or their wives and their descendants. It is the present
opinion of the undersigned that such a step will probably be
expedient, when all their children shall have attained adult age,
with a view, perhaps, of a similar arrangement being entered into
by such of their descendants as may desire it.</p>

<p>“That in the ultimate division of the Fund, regard should be
had first to the unmerited necessities of the respective families;
secondly, to the amount of aid which shall have been previously
afforded to each from the Fund; and, lastly, to the total amount
contributed.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Family Fund existed for many years. At last
it had done its work, and it was brought to a close.
Whereupon the four brothers issued the following address
to “the junior members of the Hill family”:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many of you know that until lately there existed, under the
name of the Family Fund, a joint property formed by contributions
from several members of the family, and intended to serve as a
security against pecuniary distress on the part either of the subscribers,
or of those immediately dependent on them. As each
of us who did so subscribe subsequently accumulated property
sufficient for the limited security required, as the above arrangement
was attended with trouble, and, in the unsatisfactory state of the
laws respecting property, might, at some future time, have caused
serious difficulties, we brought it to a close, and divided the property
of which we had thus been joint owners.</p>

<p>“As this dissolution is liable to misapprehension, we think it may
be useful to you to be informed that it proceeds from no distrust of
the principle on which the Family Fund was established; which,
indeed, we still regard as perfectly sound in itself, and, under a
better state of the law, equally applicable to any set of persons who,
having confidence in each other, are yet, individually, of such
limited means, as to stand exposed to risk of pecuniary difficulties.</p>

<p>“The principle involved is simply that of insurance, founded on
the undoubted fact that want is a greater evil than wealth, beyond a
simple competence, is a benefit; and that, consequently, where the
income is either terminable or uncertain, it is wise, after providing
the necessaries of life, to employ at least a part of the remainder in
purchasing security for the future.</p>

<p>“We may add that in such a union, beyond the mere material
benefit, there naturally arises a moral influence of considerable
power; and of this we have experienced the advantage; our connection
having been sufficiently close to give to each of us, in a
great measure, the benefit of the experience, knowledge, and
judgment, of all the others, and to secure to each that friendly
advice of which every one, some time or other, stands in need.</p>

<p>“We attribute such success as has attended our family, and such
respect as it has obtained, very much to the spirit of co-operation
which was recommended to us by our parents during their lives and
on their death-beds; and which we, in turn, living and dying, would
recommend to our successors as amongst the best means of enabling
them to do good to themselves individually and collectively, and no
less to their fellow-creatures at large.</p>

<p>As they trusted each other for aid in case of need,
so at all times did they look to each other for counsel.
The affairs of all were known to each. At every
important turn, each sought the judgment of all. “I
have mentioned your advice to the Family Council,”
wrote Rowland Hill, in the year 1825, to his eldest
brother. “After some discussion, the following agreement
was come to.” In describing a decision to which
he came twelve years after this date, he writes: “As
usual in cases of great difficulty, I consulted my father
and my brothers.” Eleven years later he entered in
his Journal: “E. H., A. H., F. H., and I, met to
consult on the steps to be taken in consequence of
the Postmaster-General’s communication, and decided
what should be done. These family consultations are
a great aid to me.” When he was bringing the great
work of his life to a close, he did not, he writes, send
in his resignation, as Secretary to the Post-office, till
he had first consulted his brothers. The following
letter, which he wrote to his eldest brother, shows, not
only how strongly he felt the advantages of this family
union, but also how ready he always was to own, and
own to the full, how much he himself had owed to it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Hampstead, 4th December, 1867.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Matthew</span>,—Thank you very much for your kind
and affectionate letter. Fortunately, the members of our family have
always been ready to assist one another—consequently, each has
worked with the combined force of all. This was markedly the
case as regards Penny Postage, as I have endeavoured to show
in the history. But for your great help and that of our brothers,
I should have accomplished but little.</p>

<p>“No one, I am sure, has a better right to draw consolation from
past services than yourself. Not only have you individually and
directly effected a vast amount of good, but you have been the
pioneer for us all.</p>

<p class="center">“Very affectionately yours,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>.”</p>

<p class="center">[<i>A fac-simile of this letter is given over-leaf.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>In the earlier meetings of the Family Council, rules
were sometimes laid down for their own guidance.
Some of the brothers took too little heed to what
they said before outsiders; and, when politics or
religion was the subject of talk, forgot that they
were schoolmasters, and spoke out with the freedom
of men. The Council accordingly passed the following
resolution: “It is our opinion that when anyone,
by announcing an opinion, or by a mode of expression,
has startled his hearers, that circumstance is a
strong presumptive proof that he has done an injury
to himself.” This is worthy of La Rochefoucauld
himself, and yet it was but little acted on, it would
seem, by some of the members. Rowland Hill,
writing to one of his brothers about the time when
this resolution was passed, says: “In making your
own conduct conform to that which we all agree to
be right, you exercise a degree of self-control which
no other member of the family has ever evinced.”
It was to this rule, I have no doubt, that he was
referring. At another meeting of the Council, I find
it recorded: “It is desirable to settle how far perfection
of speculative opinion should be sacrificed to
practical effect.” The question, I fear, remains
unsettled to the present day.</p>

<p>This curious league of the brothers was due to
many causes. From childhood they had been steadily
trained up in it by their parents. They had long
lived all together under the same roof. The eldest
son, who left home at an earlier age than any of
the rest, did not finally quit it till he was six-and-twenty.
Each had a thorough knowledge of the
character of all the rest, and this knowledge resulted
in thorough trust. They had all come to have a
remarkable agreement on most points—not only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
principle, but also of practice. The habits of one,
with but few exceptions, were the habits of all. He
who had ascertained what one brother thought on
any question would not have been likely to go wrong,
had he acted on the supposition that he knew what
was thought by all. They were all full of high aims—all
bent on “the accomplishment of things permanently
great and good.” There was no room in
their minds for the petty thoughts of jealous spirits.
Each had that breadth of view which enables a man
to rise above all selfish considerations. Each had
been brought up to consider the good of his family
rather than his own peculiar good, and to look upon
the good of mankind as still higher than the good
of his family. Each was deeply convinced of the
great truth which Priestley had discovered, and
Bentham had advocated—that the object of all
government, and of all social institutions, should
be the greatest happiness of the greatest number
for the greatest length of time. In their youth
their aims were often visionary; but they were
always high and noble. If they were daring enough
to attempt to improve mankind, they were, at all
events, wise enough to begin their task by setting
about to improve themselves. One of the brothers
had by nature a hot temper. He was, as a boy,
“jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel.”
He was the first of them “deliberately and seriously
to adopt the maxim which treats all anger as folly....
Having arrived at a principle, and that
while yet a youth, he strove earnestly, and with great
success, to reduce it to practice.” Certainly his latter
years were all placidity. Another brother had convinced
himself “that men become what they are, not
of themselves, but by birth, education, fellowship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
other such influences; and, therefore, he regarded the
slightest approach to vindictive feeling as both wrong
and foolish.” Whatever wrongs he has suffered through
life—and he has had his share—he has never suffered
the pure benevolence of his soul to be for one moment
clouded over by resentment. In truth, they all, at all
times, with set purpose, aimed at placing themselves
under the guidance of reason.</p>

<p>They had all been trained by their father from their
earliest years to reason, and to reason not for victory
but for truth. As the family day by day gathered for
its meals—meals of the most frugal kind, where, for
many years, nothing stronger than water was drunk—there
was often held a debate on—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“Labour and the changing mart,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the framework of the land.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this debate all, parents and children alike, were
on an equality. Age was never put forward as a substitute
for argument. There had been little timidity
in any of them in their early days, and little fear of
pushing any principle to its extreme consequences.
“Keble,” writes Dr. Newman,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> “was a man who
guided himself and formed his judgments, not by
processes of reason, by inquiry, or by argument, but,
to use the word in a broad sense, by authority.”
Rowland Hill, and the other members of his family,
were the exact opposite of Keble. They cared
nothing for authority in the sense in which Dr.
Newman uses the word. On reason, inquiry, and
argument, and on them alone, were their judgments
formed.</p>

<p>Into such questions as these the elder of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sisters entered with scarcely less eagerness than her
brothers. She had the same “hereditary detestation
of tyranny and injustice,” and the same “ardent zeal
in the cause of civil and religious freedom.” She was
as thorough-going a reformer as any of them—“yet a
Woman too.” She had her brother Rowland’s high
courage and his quiet fortitude also. At the time
of the fire at Hazelwood she was but a girl: yet so
great were the efforts that she then made that she
injured her spine. A year and a-half she was forced
to spend on the couch. “Her household motions,
light and free” as they had hitherto been, were
suddenly checked. “Nevertheless, throughout this
long period,” says one, who spent much of the time
with her, “no murmur was ever heard.” We, who
knew her only in her latter years, let our memory
dwell, with a pleasure and a consolation that never
fail, on her wonderful equanimity, her gentle disposition,
and her comprehensive love. The few who
can remember her girlhood say that it showed the
woman “as morning shows the day.” She married
early, but she married the warm friend of all her
brothers—the upright son of the upright schoolmaster
who, for conscience sake, had braved the violence of a
furious mob.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Her new home was close to Hazelwood,
and so by her marriage the family circle was
rather widened than narrowed. The younger sister
was an invalid from her infancy. Her disposition was
gentle and loving, but throughout her short life she
was one who was much more called upon to bear
than to do.</p>

<p>“An awful blank” was made in the family group by
the death of Howard, the youngest son. He bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
name of the great and good man whose friendship to
his father’s uncle was the boast of his family. Had he
been granted a long life even that high name might
have received from him fresh honour. He was but
five-and-twenty years old when he was cut off by
consumption. Like many another who has suffered
under that malady, he was happily buoyed up by hope
nearly to the end. Almost up to his last day the light
of a bright vision, on which he had for some time
dwelt, had not faded away from his sky. “He was
bent on showing the world an example of a community
living together on principles strictly social.” He had
saved some money, and all that he had, and himself
too, he was ready to sacrifice for the good of his community.
Much time he purposed to spend in travelling
on foot gathering information, and still more time
was to be spent in acquiring the power of enduring
bodily toil. He hoped that others would contribute
towards the furtherance of his scheme, but he would
accept, he said, no contribution as a loan. His
colony he meant to settle with foundling children of
the age of two years.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whether I should begin with one or ten infants, or any intermediate
number, would chiefly depend on the amount of contributions
raised. I would not take more than ten for the first year,
and should afterwards increase according to my power, aiming to
about twenty-five of each sex. These children I should endeavour
to instruct to maintain and enjoy life by co-operative exertions.”</p>

</div>

<p>His utilitarianism was of no narrow kind. His aim
was the highest development of his pupils, both
morally and intellectually. He was eager to begin at
once, but if his brothers could for awhile but ill spare
his services he was willing to wait. “It must, however,
be remembered,” he wrote, “that as the success
of the experiment much depends on my power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
conforming to a new mode of life, every delay by
which my present necessarily expensive and insincere
habits are continually strengthened greatly
increases the difficulty of the proposed undertaking.”
He would have, he well knew, to face the judgment
of the world, which is always hard on those founders
of new republics or novel communities who venture
to lay their foundations outside Utopia or below the
sky.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am almost careless of the opinion of others, and am labouring
to make myself quite insensible to any expression of either praise or
blame. Further, I propose to seclude myself and <i>protegés</i> as far as
is practicable for about fifteen years.”</p>

</div>

<p>He died at an age when the growth of the mind in
all who strive after knowledge is very rapid. Had he
lived a few years longer, he would have seen that the
world, as a whole, is wiser than any one man in it, and
that total seclusion from it is the worst of all trainings
for the young. But death swept him away, and there
is nothing left of him save “a fragment from his dream
of human life.” The world never knew his great
worth, and his brothers never forgot it. “Time, and
the ordinary current of events,” wrote one of them to
his father, “have had their ordinary effect of deadening
the acuteness of our feelings, but at present the
world wears but a dreary aspect to me.” “Believe
me, my beloved son,” wrote the bereaved father a few
weeks later, “that whenever troubles assail us we
mechanically turn to thoughts of our children for
comfort.... That you and all our offspring may
be as fortunate as we respecting this first of parental
rewards, the prudence and integrity of children, is our
most earnest prayer. Greater good luck it were
useless to hope for, almost impious to desire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The vision that another brother raised was of a very
different kind. “He had read Adam Smith’s great
work as if it had been an attractive novel.” Political
economy became his favourite study. Huskisson had
just entered upon his reforms of our fiscal system, and
the youth longed to play his part in the great work of
improvement that seemed at length to have fairly
begun. For him the school was too small a stage.
“He longed for a wider scope, and, above all, a greater
power of doing good.” Huskisson must surely stand
in need, he thought, of more enlightened assistants
than he had at present. Was not his progress along
the path of reform timid and slow, and was not that
owing to the fact that, in the offices of Government,
there were few to be found but men of routine and
mummery? He asked his eldest brother whether it
would not be practicable to put him under Huskisson’s
wing. He was reminded of the boy who wished to go
apprentice to a bishop.</p>

<p>Such dreams as these were not unnatural in young
men who had lived so much to themselves. It was
not till they were grown up that they began at all to
mix in the world. When Rowland Hill was twenty,
he mentions in his Journal two young men as “almost
the only persons excepting our own family with whom
I am in habits of intimacy. Indeed, I enjoy so
much the society we have at home,” he says, “that I
do not feel the want of a very extensive circle of
friends.” “They had a little ideal world of their
own,” said one who knew them well in those days.
Such a world, however noble it may be, has its own
dangers. The high purpose, the fixed mind, the
unconquerable will, the courage never to submit or
yield, may well be nourished there; but it is on a
wider stage that a man best learns to measure life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
They who do not master this lesson betimes find it a
hard thing to master it at all; for soon custom lies
upon them with a weight—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From them no small part of the world is likely to
remain hidden. To not a little that men have thought
and felt they remain insensible. They can form a
right judgment of those who differ from them only in
opinion, but they find it hard to understand any who
go further than this, and differ from them also in sentiment.
Lord Macaulay had this defect in a striking
degree, and yet he had been brought up in a wider
circle than the life of a provincial town, and his mind
ranged within no narrow bounds.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</div>
<div class="verse">Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the greatest benefactors of mankind would
have held that, however true this might be of Horatio,
it could not rightfully be addressed to themselves.</p>

<p>When all that is needed is an appeal to reason and
not to sentiment, then in such men prejudices may
quickly fall away. Like many another ardent and
honest reformer of those days, Rowland Hill had in
his youth formed a harsh judgment of the ruling
classes. His father had belonged to a small political
club, which met once a week at the houses of the
members. “The conversation,” writes one of the
brothers, “very commonly took a political turn, the
opinions on all sides savouring of the extreme, so that
my father was, by comparison, a moderate. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
notorious that men, very remote from power, with its
duties and responsibilities, are apt to be extravagant
in expectations and demands; and so it certainly was
here. ‘I would do thus,’ or ‘I would have this,’ were
put forth in full ignorance of what was practicable,
sometimes of what was even desirable. Such discourse
could not but assist the bias already in our
minds, so that we grievously underrated the great
actual advantages and high comparative freedom
which our country enjoyed.”</p>

<p>When Rowland Hill, on one of his early visits to
London, first saw Guildhall, he wrote in his Journal:
“Much to the disgrace of the City of London, the
monument of Pitt remains there still.” In some later
year he placed opposite the word <i>disgrace</i> a mark of
interrogation. Such feelings as these, which had been
nursed in the worst days of Tory rule, began to die
out with the dawn of happier times. With the passing
of the great Reform Bill, all bitterness passed away
from him and his brothers. Nay even, into such good
heart had they been put by the repeal of the Test
and Corporation Acts, Roman Catholic Emancipation,
and the Battle of Navarino, that, though the King was
George IV., yet at a small supper-party at Hazelwood
one of them struck up, “The King: God bless him,”
and all joined heartily in the refrain. Their enthusiasm
was partly due to some spirited political verses composed
and recited by Sheridan Knowles, who happened
to be one of the guests. “It was not without considerable
feeling,” wrote one of the brothers, “that
we afterwards learnt that, while this loyal effusion was
pouring forth, the poor King was dying.”</p>

<p>The removal to the neighbourhood of London at
once opened to Rowland Hill a wider world:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“In November, 1826 [he wrote], I assisted in founding the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, which, commencing
public operation in the following year, took so active and important
a part in the creation of cheap literature. Though as a
member of the committee<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> I took some share in the duty, I fear,
upon reflection, that such aid as I was enabled to give was
scarcely equivalent to the benefit which I derived from association
with the able and eminent men with whom I was thus brought in
contact.”</p>

</div>

<p>His residence at Bruce Castle he but briefly described
in the Prefatory Memoir to “The History of
Penny Postage.” It was, to a great extent, the life
of a schoolmaster; and that life in the earlier part
of the narrative had been set forth at considerable
length. The following is the account he gave of these
years:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During a portion of 1829, and throughout the two following
years, I occupied part of my leisure hours in devising means of
measuring time, in connection with astronomical observations, more
minutely than had hitherto been done. With this view I tried many
experiments, and succeeded in carrying accuracy of measurement
first to one-tenth, and by a subsequent improvement, to one-hundredth
of a second. In June, 1832, I addressed a letter to the
Council of the Astronomical Society, of which I had been a member
for about seven years, showing the principle of my device, which is
in some measure indicated by the name I gave it, viz., the ‘Vernier
pendulum,’<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and applying for the loan of one of the Society’s
clocks, with a view to further experiment. This being granted, I
continued my investigation for some time, when it was brought to a
close by a circumstance which, combined with others, changed my
whole course of life. I shall, therefore, only further remark that as the
letter just mentioned records a piece of work to which I gave much
time and thought, and of which I felt then, and perhaps feel still, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
little proud, I have given it in Appendix D. My invention, I must
add, never came into use, being superseded by an adaptation of electricity
to the same purpose, which, while equal in accuracy, had the
advantage of much readier use.</p>

<p>“My health, which had already twice broken down under the
weight of my work, now began to show signs of permanent injury;
and I was becoming sensible of the necessity for some change,
though to obtain this was no easy matter. Simple rest I feared
would not answer the purpose, as my mind was likely, by mere force
of habit, to revert to my suspended duties, and moreover to busy
itself with anxiety about the little family now depending upon me.
Change of occupation was, therefore, what I sought, and this was
one motive to the astronomical investigations previously referred to.
I found, however, that so long as I remained at my post, there was
small hope of substantial benefit, and I began to consider the
means of release. In 1831 I had prepared for Lord Brougham a
paper which I entitled ‘Home Colonies: Sketch of a Plan for the
Gradual Extinction of Pauperism and for the Diminution of Crime;’
and this, with Lord Brougham’s consent, was published in 1832.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
My hope in writing it, beyond that of doing good, had been that it
might lead to my temporary employment by Government in examination
of the Home Colonies of Holland, which were at that time
attracting much public attention, and seemed to afford valuable
suggestions for the improvement of our own Poor Law Administration,
then, as is well known, in a lamentable state. One great
object of the plan, as set forth in my pamphlet, was the education of
the pauper colonists. The pamphlet excited a certain amount of
interest, as well among working-men as those higher in society: but
I had yet to learn how strongly the doors of every Government
office are barred against all intruders, and how loud and general
must be the knocking before they will open. I must in fairness add
that I had also to be made aware how much official doors are beset
by schemers, and how naturally groundless projects raise a prejudice
against all proposals whatever. Any one curious on the subject may
find some notice of the plan in the ‘Penny Magazine,’ Vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 42.
However, I scarcely need add that no result followed, either to the
public or to myself, the evils which I had sought to mitigate being
otherwise grappled with in the Poor Law Reform of 1834.</p>

<p>“Meantime my malady increased, and it was at length determined
that the school at Hazelwood should be disposed of, and the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to Bruce Castle made complete, the middle of 1833 being fixed
upon as the time for the change. My intention was to employ the
whole of the midsummer holidays, and as much more time as I
could profitably so spend, in a tour on the Continent, leaving the
question of my return to be decided by the state of my health and
other circumstances. I had begun to feel unsettled in my occupation.
In addition to its wearing effect upon my health, I had
begun to doubt the expediency of my continuing in a profession into
which I had entered rather from necessity than from choice, though
I had subsequently laboured in it, like other members of my family,
with zeal and even enthusiasm, and in which the very progress made
by the school in public estimation made my position on some important
points increasingly uncomfortable. This pressed the more
after the untimely death of one of the two brothers associated with
me at Bruce Castle, the youngest of our family, who, having enjoyed
many of those advantages in education which were denied to me,
had been as it were my complement. It is true, indeed, that the
accession of my brother Arthur from Hazelwood brought present
relief, but this also facilitated my withdrawal, giving me as a
successor one whose heart I knew to be fully and fixedly engaged
in his work.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> My ambition had grown with our success, or rather,
indeed, far outrun it; and I was now thoroughly convinced—partly,
I must admit, by a check in our tide of success—that in my present
career, unless I could add to my other qualifications those classical
acquirements which rank so high in general estimation, it could have
no sufficient scope. I think, indeed, I was perfectly honest in saying,
as I did at the time, that neither wealth nor power was my main
object, though I was not insensible to the allurements of either, but
that it was indispensable to my desires to do, or at least to attempt,
something which would make the world manifestly the better for my
having lived in it. What that was to be I could by no means tell,
further than that it must be some work of organization, which I
knew to be my forte; but that point secured, I still felt, notwithstanding
my impaired health, my old unlimited confidence as to
achievement. All this may have been very rash, and even foolish;
I merely mention it as a fact, and look upon it as turning out
fortunate, since it was essential to the sequel.</p>

<p>“Although, however, I separated myself from duties in which I
had been earnestly engaged for three-and-twenty years, I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
lost interest in the school, nor ever failed to render it such assistance
as lay in my power. I gladly hailed the early return of its prosperity;
and at the end of thirty-six years from my withdrawal I
rejoice to see it still flourishing.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“The check in the tide of success” was in great
measure due to the failure in Rowland Hill’s health.
There were other causes, however, at work. On some
of these I have already touched, while others I could
not at present with any propriety describe. The
description is the less needful as with them he was
only remotely connected. It was not wonderful that
his health began, as he said, to show signs of permanent
injury. Less than two years after he had been
warned that he must abandon any plan that should
demand unusual energy, he had, in defiance of his
doctor, opened his new school. In December, 1829,
in June, 1832, and in December, 1832, I find the state
of his health made the subject of anxious discussion in
the Family Council. His work as a schoolmaster was
becoming distasteful to him, and he was beginning to
long for a change. He longed still more eagerly for
that freedom of thought, speech, and action, which
even at the present day a schoolmaster can but very
imperfectly command. It was in change of occupation
that his active mind for many a long year always found
its best repose. Besides the matters that he has
recorded in the extract that I have just given, he
seems, at this time of his life, to have turned over in
his mind many other schemes. The following I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
found jotted down in a memorandum, dated December,
1832:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Pendulous Mechanism applied to Steam-Engines.</li>
<li>Propelling Steamboats by a Screw.</li>
<li>Improvement in Bramah’s Press.</li>
<li>Plan for Checking the Speed of Stage-Coaches.</li>
<li>Weighing Letters.</li>
<li>Assorting Letters in Coach.</li>
<li>Telegraphs: by Pressure of Air, &amp;c.</li>
<li>Gas: for Distant Places Compressed along Small Pipes.</li>
<li>Road-making by Machinery.</li>
</ul>

<p>To one scheme he must have given not a little
thought, though I cannot find that he ever brought
it before the world. It is curious as containing, as he
says, the germs, and something more than the germs,
of the Parcels Delivery Company, the General Omnibus
Company, and the District Post. In 1873, he thus
docketed the paper in which it is described: “I have
no recollection as regards this scheme; but I presume
that it was one of my several projects to obtain a
living after I had withdrawn from the school.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>All his brothers but one had become still more eager
than himself to give up school keeping. One alone
was happy in his work. He throughout life loved his
school as much as his scholars loved him. Rowland
Hill was not singular in his family in his desire “to
do, or at least to attempt, something which would
make the world manifestly the better for my having
lived in it.” I find recorded in the handwriting of
another of the brothers at this date that “his favourite
objects are connected with improvements in the art
and science of national government; and the happiest
position in which he can hope or desire to be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
is one in which he is pursuing such objects, in conjunction
with the other members of the family.” To
carry out their objects they required comparative
leisure and complete freedom of action. Some of
them had more than once turned their eyes towards
the community of New Harmony, which Robert Owen
had lately established in Indiana, on the banks of the
Wabash. In a letter, dated February 8th, 1827,
Rowland Hill tells one of his brothers that he has
just met with a friend who had lately returned from
New Harmony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He gives excellent accounts of Harmony, though Owen has met
with the difficulties we expected on account of his indiscriminate
admissions. Several of the members of the Society of Natural
History of New York, with the president at their head, have joined
the community.... Here is a specimen of the advantages of
the system. The naturalists having made the children acquainted
with their wants, the little creatures swarm over the woods, and bring
in such an abundance of specimens that they are forming several
immense collections, some of which they will present to new communities,
and others will be exchanged for collections in other
quarters of the world. W—— says by these means vast numbers of
insects have been discovered, of the existence of which the world
was previously in ignorance. What think you of selling Bruce
Castle again, and going off?”</p>

</div>

<p>In a paper that he drew up a few years ago he
has left a brief record of his acquaintance with
Mr. Owen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My visit to New Lanark was the first decided step towards an
intimacy with the Owen family, which continued for many years.
From the commencement I saw much to admire in Mr. Owen’s
views; but I invariably urged him to be satisfied with their gradual
introduction, and above all not to attempt to apply them in their
complete form to persons of all ages taken indiscriminately, and
without previous training, from society at large. Mr. Owen always
evinced a most friendly, I might say affectionate, feeling towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
myself, my wife, and other members of the family. His opinions
regarding myself were shown, among other ways, by his urging me to
undertake, on terms advantageous to myself, the management of one
of his communities; but, for the reasons indicated above, I declined
the offer.”</p>

</div>

<p>Not long after the removal to Bruce Castle, some of
the brothers carefully prepared a scheme for establishing
a “Social Community.” The first mention that I
find of the plan is the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sketch out a plan detailing—first, the objects in which union
can take place with little danger of violence to our present habits;
as, united purchases of food, clothing, coals; library; news-room;
use of each other’s knowledge and connections; cooking; rooms
and apparatus for receiving friends, parties, &amp;c. (persons not to go to
each other’s houses unless invited. If one wants society, he must go
to the public rooms); pleasure grounds; baths; cab or omnibus.</p>

<p>“Economy of having men of various professions united, as a
medical man, a lawyer, architect, schoolmaster; house-warmer;
telegraph for own use and for hired use.”</p>

</div>

<p>From the scheme, when completed, I make the
following extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Plan Proposed.</span></p>

<p>“<i>Object.</i>—The union of the family and the formation of a small
community of persons, in addition to the family, thinking and feeling
as we do.</p>

<p>“The Community to be established near London, for the sake of
access to the world at large, and to be located on a farm for the sake
of economy, and as a means of providing profitable and healthy
employment for the members during part of each day.</p>

<p>“Plans either for public good or private emolument to be matured
in the Community, and then either prosecuted at the Community’s
establishment or carried into effect in the world at large by members
liberated for a time for that purpose.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Preparatory Steps.</span></p>

<p>“Find a case in which an intelligent man has left other pursuits
for farming, and has succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Find an intelligent person familiar with farming pursuits, and
proper as a member of the Community.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“Draw up a statement showing the probable yearly income and
expenditure in conducting a farm of —— acres at —— near
London. Also the probable amount of the produce of such farm—the
kinds of produce which it is best to grow—the amount of
assistance required—of superintendence—of risk—the principal
sources of pleasure or annoyance in farming occupations—how far
they are conducive to health—especially as regards the members of
our own family.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“Check among ourselves, in every possible way consistent with
our present position, expensive habits of every kind, and even
desires for costly gratifications. Encourage habits of simplicity and
economy, and in every way prepare for entering into a state of
comparative seclusion and frugality.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Advantages Expected.</span></p>

<p>“Release from many unpleasant restrictions as to the free expression
of opinion, to dress, to absurd customs.</p>

<p>“Economy in houses, clothes, food, fire, artificial light, and
matters of appearance generally.</p>

<p>“Superior education for our children.</p>

<p>“Superior opportunities of obtaining knowledge ourselves by
observations, experiments, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Release from perplexing and harassing responsibilities.</p>

<p>“Release from the necessity of compelling the observance, on
the part of others, of matters often really opposed to wisdom and
sound morality, and very frequently of merely conventional value.</p>

<p>“Society. Enjoyment of that of most of the members of our own
family, and that of persons of similar views, who might be willing to
join in the plan.</p>

<p>“Probable power of appearing before the world advantageously
by means of discoveries mechanical, scientific, agricultural, or
otherwise.</p>

<p>“Increased security from infectious disorders, anarchy, injury by
change in the national prosperity; also the security which arises
from the cultivation of economical habits.</p>

<p>“Mitigation of the evils consequent upon the employment of
servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Improvement of habits by the influence of numbers upon the
individual character of members of the Community.</p>

<p>“Great advantages of the close union of a variety of talent by
the collection of a number of persons, and their intimate organization
and knowledge of each other.</p>

<p>“Facility for bringing the whole strength of the Community to
bear upon one point when needful.</p>

<p>“Increased opportunities of producing extensive good.</p>

<p>“(Improvements in machinery, farming, &amp;c., may be introduced
without producing even temporary distress, if the Community can
execute its own labour.)”</p>

</div>

<p>The “great advantages of the close union of a
variety of talent” were seen by a man who had been
trained in a widely different school. In the year
1836, Rowland Hill received the following letter from
his friend Mr. John Lefevre.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Hill</span>,—It has frequently occurred to me that
if eight or ten individuals of average intellect were to direct their
attention simultaneously and in concert on any specific object which
it might be desirable to invent, or any particular subject which it
might be useful to explain, their joint efforts might produce a more
satisfactory result than the unaided powers of a single person,
although such person might be considerably superior to any one of
the parties to the combination. I am anxious to try this experiment,
and it would give me great pleasure if you would join me in it.</p>

<p>“I would propose that you and Coode<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and I should each
choose two associates, to be approved of by us all, and that the nine
associates should meet once a month about seven in the evening.</p>

<p>“Each should furnish two questions for the consideration of the
association, and out of these we would fix on two or three for the
subject of each meeting.</p>

<p>“One of us should in turn act as the <i>reporter</i> of the meeting, <i>i.e.</i>,
he should be responsible for a statement of the result.</p>

<p>“The subjects should, in the first instance, be as simple as
possible, and should be such as to be matters of scientific amusement
rather than of importance I say this because by adopting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
this course, if the whole thing fails, we shall only have been amused
without having been disappointed.</p>

<p>“Let me know at your leisure what you think of this, and do not
mention it to any one until you have made up your own mind on its
<i>primâ facie</i> practicability.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours ever,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">J. Lefevre</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I heartily concurred in the suggestion,” Sir Rowland Hill has
recorded, “and the first meeting was, I think, held at my house.
My nominees were Mr. Wheatstone and my brother Edwin.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Among the earliest subjects of conversation were Wheatstone’s
Telegraph—not then in practical use—and my printing machine....
I brought under the consideration of my friends a question
which I had long had in mind, as to whether steamships could not
use as fuel the hydrogen of the sea-water; but Coode, who was a
remarkably well-informed and clear-headed man, succeeded in showing
that the heat which would be lost in extracting the hydrogen
would be equal to that gained by its combustion. Consequently
that what I aimed at was really, though in a disguised form, nothing
else than a perpetual motion. So far as my memory serves, this was
anterior to the announcement of the doctrine of the correlation of
forces.”</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly after I had lighted on a copy of the scheme
of a Social Community, I called on Sir Rowland
Hill. The following is my note of the conversation
that passed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I talked to him about the scheme of a Social Community. He
said that it was mainly the project of some of his brothers, but that
he quite approved of it. Their chief aims were to escape from work
that was too severe, and to get complete freedom of speech. He
had no doubt that they should have made it answer. They were
resolved to be very frugal. I said that to most men of business the
scheme would seem that of madmen. He answered that at that
time there were many such projects supported by men of great
weight. Owen’s plan was more or less approved of by Brougham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and others. He (Sir R. Hill) and his brothers saw great merits in it,
though they also saw great faults.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following letter, which he wrote to one of his
brothers in defence of the scheme before it had as
yet in any way taken shape, throws much light on
the objects that they had in view:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am very sorry, and not a little surprised, that our plan should
have been so far misunderstood as to cause so much alarm on the
part of mother and yourself, and I hasten to remove your fears by
simply telling you what the plan is. The only plan to which I have
given my consent is this:—To ascertain, in the most satisfactory
manner, by enquiry and even by experiment, what is the smallest
sum on which we can live with economy but comfort, avoiding all
such expenses as are at present incurred, not because they are
conducive to happiness, but because we are expected by others to
meet them; yet at the same time indulging in some gratifications
which we are at present denied. In determining this sum to allow
nothing whatever for the produce of our labour, letting that stand
as security against the ill-effects of any error in our calculation.
Having determined this amount, to ascertain next, how much capital,
secured in the fullest manner, as by mortgage on ample freehold
landed property, would afford the required income, and then to
continue our present undertaking till such a capital is raised....
I think you will now see that our views are by no means very
dissimilar. Your wish is, I believe, to save money with the intention
of retiring and living on your savings at some future time. You
perhaps would wait, till you can maintain without labour the same
rank you now hold, still continuing to mix with the world and to
conform with the world’s notions of propriety and happiness. We
are for separating from society so far as may be necessary to
enable us to regulate our mode of living solely with a reference
to <i>our own</i> conceptions of comfort. We conceive that our plan
promises these advantages over yours, that it will enable us to put it
into execution earlier, and that we shall be more happy when it is
executed than if we adopted your plan.</p>

<p>“The very common plan of working very hard during the best
years of your life, in order that you may heap up security for future
comfort, is, I think we are all agreed, a very mistaken one. It is
much wiser to be satisfied with a less amount of security, and enjoy
your ease while your spirits and health remain unimpaired, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
before your habits are so far fixed as to render any change undesirable.
Still there is an amount of security which is necessary
to prevent care and anxiety; but that necessary amount will, of
course, be proportionate to the scale of living you may adopt.</p>

<p>“To me it appears to be of very little consequence whether we
are consistent or not, but it is very important to be right.</p>

<p>“If we have been right hitherto, we should make no change
because we have been right; if we have been wrong, it would be
unwise to continue so for the sake of being consistent. I know that
right and wrong are here comparative; and that it may be wise to
continue in a path which you have already trodden, though it may
not be the most direct, or the least rugged, rather than encounter
the hedges and ditches which may lie between you and the straight
and even road. But if you can satisfy yourself that the advantages
of the direct road will, in all probability, more than balance the
labour and risk of getting into it, you would be foolish not to make
the change. I am not begging the question by assuming that the
proposed course is the best; I only wish to show on what grounds
the propriety of a change ought to be discussed.</p>

<p>“Though I disregard a character for consistency, which is a virtue
or a vice according to circumstances (which is it in Lord Eldon?)
yet I am desirous to show that I have not made so many mistakes,
nor so decidedly changed my views as you imagine. I conceive
that we have been already remunerated for the additional outlay
in building at Hazelwood. With the views I now advocate, the
propriety of purchasing Bruce Castle may be questioned; but I
do not see that the step was manifestly improper. The buildings
and grounds would, in all probability, sell for more than they cost
us.... My views have certainly changed inasmuch as I am
now inclined to abandon the hope of establishing the College, or
collection of schools of which I used to talk; but the change has
been caused by circumstances as unexpected by others as they were
by myself. I allude to the great reduction in numbers at Hazelwood,
and to the present prospects there and here (we expect barely
to maintain our late number), showing, I fear, diminished confidence
in the public—to the vexations arising from the fact of our being
obliged to teach so much which we consider as nearly useless, and,
in some cases, very mischievous—from the unreasonable expectations
of the friends of our pupils, and from the still-continuing caprices
of the parents, as manifested constantly by the removal of boys with
whom we have been most successful.... I think too that we
are all wearing ourselves out very fast, and that the time is not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
far distant when some of us will be obliged to stop, without perhaps
health and spirits sufficient to enjoy any mode of living. As to my
anxiety to do good, it is as strong now as ever, and I think that the
proposed change, by allowing us to educate our children for a better
state of society, will enable us through their means to do good much
more effectually, and even speedily, than we could on any other plan....
As regards myself, even if you were all the warmest advocates
of the plan, it is very possible that I might never share its advantages.
I have not as yet said anything to my wife on the subject.
It is true that she often talks of retirement as a desirable thing,
but even if she should be inclined to join in this very economical
plan of retirement, I think the persuasions of her friends would very
likely influence her against it, and without her consent I shall not
join in it myself.”</p>

</div>

<p>Rowland Hill was, indeed, a man, to use Gibbon’s
words, “whom nature had designed to think as he
pleased, and to speak as he thought.” Such freedom
as this is only enjoyed in its fullest extent by those
who have secured “independence, that first earthly
blessing.” But independence, if it is chiefly enjoyed
by men of ample means, is, nevertheless, within the
reach of those who have but simple wants. Yet after
all there was not a little truth in what their old father
wrote on hearing of this scheme of his sons: “My
dear son Rowland. You and your brothers are the last
men to make monks of.”</p>

<p>Such a scheme as this has a strong outward
resemblance to the Pantisocracy of Southey and
Coleridge; but the differences between the two
schemes are far greater than the resemblances. The
two poets were as young as they were unversed in
the ways of the world, when the delightful prospect
of happiness opened before their view to live with
their friends in the most agreeable and most honourable
employment, to eat the fruits they had raised,
and see every face happy around them.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of friends whom they had gathered round them were,
perhaps, not more experienced than themselves. But
the planners of the other scheme were men who had
spent many years in hard work, and in habits of strict
economy. They did not, like the two poets, look
upon money as a huge evil with which, happily,
they should not long have to contend. They had
learnt its value. They knew how to buy and
how to sell. They had a certain amount of capital
at their command. Two of them, moreover, were
skilful in the use of tools, and fertile in mechanical
inventions. They had long tried in their family union
the plan of a Social Community, and were entering
upon their undertaking with a clear insight into the
difficulties which awaited them. They were fully
alive, moreover, to the dangers that Owen had brought
upon himself by his indiscriminate admission of all
comers. They only proposed to invite men to join
them with whose characters they had first become
thoroughly acquainted. In a list of “members
apparently qualified,” I find the names of Dr. Southwood
Smith and Mr. Roebuck. “I formed an
intimate acquaintance with Mr. Roebuck,” Sir Rowland
Hill has recorded, “about the year 1830. In
1832 (I think) my wife nursed him through a long
illness at Bruce Castle.” Their <i>Social Community</i> was
not so much an end in itself as a means towards
other and far higher ends. They had schemes for
moving the earth; but they wanted a fulcrum.
They had no leisure. What Rowland Hill could
do when he was free from his school, he showed
in the next four years of his life. In the spare
time that a man could command who was Secretary
to a new and active Commission, he invented, as
will be seen, a printing-press, and devised his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
scheme of Postal Reform. In like manner his
youngest surviving brother, who, a year or two after
the Social Community was planned, was made the
First Inspector of Prisons in Scotland, had in no long
time thoroughly reformed them, and made them a
model for the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>No steps were taken to carry through their scheme.
It had scarcely been completed on paper before
Rowland Hill obtained, what he had long wanted, “a
work of organisation.” Within no long time all the
other brothers were happily engaged in occupations
that suited their powers and their tastes. “When I
was a young man,” said Sir Rowland Hill one day to
me, “there were very few careers open. I never even
dreamed of the possibility of getting into the Civil
Service.” A new career, however, was at length
opening for him, and the long, though broken, course
of his public services was on the point of beginning.
To this point I have traced his life, and here I shall
bring the first part of my task to an end. His history
for the next thirty years will be given in his own
narrative. I shall take up my pen again at the date
of his retirement, and do my best to describe the
closing years of his long and honourable life. My
task will be no easy one, for</p>

<p>[In the Summer of 1833, as has been shown, Rowland
Hill had gone abroad for the benefit of his health. In the
Prefatory Memoir to the History of Penny Postage, he thus
carries down from that date the history of his life to the year
when his great occupation first took strong hold of his mind.]</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had spent some weeks in France, without, however, having
gone further than Orleans (travelling was slow in those days), when
an opportunity for such a change as I was revolving in my mind
happened to present itself. A project was forming for the colonisation
of the then unoccupied territory now called South Australia, the
prime mover being the late Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, with
whom I had previously some acquaintance, and who, indeed, had
shown me a year before a prospectus of his enterprise, in which,
however, all places for names, whether directors or officers, were then
vacant. Meeting him now in France, I was invited by him to join
in the scheme, being also assured that several men of high character
and position had already done so. His proposal was that, in the
event of his project being launched, I should be secretary in
England; while another gentleman, the late Mr. Gouger, was to
be secretary in the new colony. Though very unwilling to cut my
holiday so short, yet fearing that if I missed this opportunity I might
not soon find another equally promising, I determined on accepting
the offer, and went forthwith to my work.</p>

<p>“The change was obviously a very great one, and it was to be
seen how far my past training, if I may apply the term to what was
in so large a degree fortuitous, had fitted me for the duties that now
devolved upon me. Necessity had taught me diligence, punctuality,
and perseverance; and combined with inclination, and perhaps
some natural aptitude, it had cultivated in me the power and habit
of invention, created a certain versatility, and armed me with boldness
to surmount obstacles, to disregard mere conventionalisms, and
to feel and exercise a certain independence of spirit. I had also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
been led to acquire a power of influencing and directing others, and
of holding subordinates to responsibility. In my new occupation all
these powers and habits were to find abundant exercise; and the
question naturally arises in my mind whether, considering all that
lay before me, the course of circumstances by which they had been
formed or strengthened was not more fortunate than the training
which would have been given by a more premeditated and systematic
mode of proceeding, with ample means at command. Had I been
more regularly prepared for the profession I was leaving, should I
have been equally able to perform what I afterwards accomplished,
or indeed equally fitted to make those improvements in school
management of which I have already spoken, and which, however
trivial some of them may appear in these more advanced days, were
at the time decided and even bold innovations?<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>“Before going on to my proceedings in reference to the South
Australian Association, I will, for the sake of convenience, mention
two passages which occurred in the midst of them; and here I will
take the liberty to remark that, though I had ceased to take part in
formal education, I nevertheless bore the general object constantly
in mind, and made all my subsequent efforts more or less subservient
thereto.</p>

<p>“In the year 1834 I took, with others, an active part in proposing
that total abolition of the stamp duty on newspapers which was
effected about twenty-five years later: and I endeavoured to show, I
still think correctly, that this might be done with little or no loss to
the revenue. It must be remembered that there was then a heavy
duty on advertisements, and my expectation was that the field for
advertising would so increase, and thereby so multiply advertisements,
as soon to restore the whole fiscal produce of newspapers
to its former amount. In estimating the probable increase in the
number of newspapers, I applied a principle on which I subsequently
relied in reference to postal reform, viz., that the cheapening of an
article in general demand does not as a rule diminish the total
public expenditure thereon, the increased consumption making up
for the diminished price. Perhaps the actual state of things (1869),
though the matter is complicated by the repeal of the advertisement
duty, may be regarded as sufficient to show that such expectation
was not unreasonable. These views I set forth when I went up in a
deputation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and the late Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Monteagle, who then held the office, not only did me the honour to
listen with much attention, but requested that he might be supplied
with further information on the subject—a request with which I
complied as soon as I could collect the necessary materials. The
result, as may be remembered, was not the total abolition, but a
reduction of the stamp duty, from about threepence-halfpenny (net)
to one penny; an excellent measure in itself, yet but feebly tending
to that recuperation for which I looked; since the retention of any
duty left a serious obstacle to the multiplication of journals, a fact
abundantly shown <i>e converso</i> by subsequent events. My argument
on the subject will be found in full in the ‘Companion to the
Newspaper’ for June 1st, 1834; where also, I may observe, may
be seen the first suggestion of stamped covers, though not in relation
to letters. The suggestion came from the editor, Mr. Charles
Knight, and was indeed in some sort indispensable to the plan of
total abolition, since the unstamped newspapers would not be transmissible
by post without payment; and this, if made in money,
would seriously add to the trouble of transmission. Of course,
adhesive stamps were as yet undreamt of.</p>

<p>“In looking over the paper referred to, I find that, at the time
when I drew it up, London was the only town in Great Britain
which produced a daily newspaper; that there were but six other
towns with papers issued oftener than once per week; only two
of the six being in England, viz., Liverpool and Canterbury.</p>

<p>“The other passage referred to is my addressing a letter to Lord
Brougham, in April, 1834, on the subject of pauper education. The
bill subsequently called the New Poor Law was then in progress
through Parliament, and the intended changes seemed to me to
afford an opportunity, not to be neglected, for improving the education
of pauper children, then for the most part in a wretched state,
the schoolmasters being very frequently themselves paupers. To
suggest this improvement was the object of my letter.</p>

<p>“I pointed out that the union of parishes, combined with the
proposed classification of paupers (a design unfortunately but very
imperfectly realized), would bring together large numbers of pauper
children, and thus facilitate their education. By reference to the
report of the Commissioners, I showed that children educated in
workhouses became for the most part paupers for life; while in the
few parishes where good education had already been established, few
remained chargeable beyond the age of childhood; that by making
good education general, one great source of pauperism would be
stopped; and that even as regarded immediate benefit, if industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
occupation were introduced into the schools, the expense of maintaining
the children would be partly defrayed by the results of their
labour, while such occupation instead of retarding would even
promote their intellectual progress. After urging some further
considerations, I concluded by offering any assistance that I could
give in forming a complete plan. Perhaps amidst Lord Brougham’s
multitudinous duties he had no attention to spare for the proposal;
perhaps the difficulty with which the actual changes were made,
and the outcry long maintained against them, may have indisposed
Government to any further innovation. But whatever may be the
explanation, I cannot avoid speculating on the amount of the benefit
which might by this time have resulted from the suggestion, had
it been adopted and efficiently worked. How much pauperism and
how much crime might have been prevented!<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>“To return now to the subject of South Australian Colonisation.
The main principles on which it was intended to proceed were, first,
that the colony should from its very establishment be self-supporting
(a condition hitherto unheard of); secondly, that means should be
taken to keep the colonists from that dispersion which had so often
produced grievous suffering and a fearful mortality; thirdly, that no
convicts should be admitted into the colony; fourthly, that means
should be taken for the immigration of a sufficient number of free
labourers; and, lastly, that in the selection of these the numbers
of the sexes should be kept equal. It is only necessary to add that,
with a view to discourage dispersion and to supply an emigration
fund, the price of land was to be fixed comparatively high, probably
at one pound per acre. All these provisions will be found embodied
in the Act of Parliament eventually passed on the subject
(4th and 5th William IV., chap. 95).</p>

<p>“As I found Mr. Wakefield’s report relative to the high character
of the association fully supported by the facts, I joined it with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hoping to avoid the expense, difficulties, uncertainty, and
delay of an application to Parliament, the association applied to
the Colonial Secretary for a charter; which, however, was refused,
partly on the alleged ground of want of precedent. As there was
no remedy, we took the necessary measures for carrying a bill
through Parliament. But here the obstacles were so many, that
earnest and able as were those who undertook the management of
the bill, viz., Colonel Torrens, Mr. Whitmore, and Mr. (now Sir
William) Hutt, there would have been but small chance of success
without some one to take upon him, as it were, the drudgery of the
process. Such aid we were fortunate enough to command in the
person of my brother Matthew, who had been elected to the first
reformed Parliament as member for Hull. By the joint efforts of
all, the bill was at length carried through both Houses.</p>

<p>“Commissioners to put the Act in execution were appointed by
the Crown, May 5th, 1835; the chairman being Colonel Torrens,
and Sir William Hutt and Sir John Lefevre being two of the
commissioners. To this body I was appointed Secretary. To
colonise, without any assistance from Government, an almost
unknown wilderness, was a sufficiently difficult task; but the
difficulties of the commission were increased by certain stipulations
which Government, doubtless a little uneasy at the novel project of
independent colonisation, had thought proper to impose.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> One of
these was the preliminary investment in Government securities of the
sum of £55,000, £35,000 to be produced by sale of land, and the
remaining £20,000 to be raised on the security both of further sales
and of the colonial revenue; the investment in full to precede the
exercise of any of the general powers and authorities under the Act.
As no surveys had yet been made, the province indeed being very
little known, and as even the site of the capital could not yet be
fixed on, compliance with such requirements was obviously difficult,
and the difficulty was increased by the want of funds with which to
pay preliminary expenses; but by great effort the necessary means
were secured before the close of November in the same year,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
here, in justice, it must be mentioned, that in the great work of
founding the colony, the Commissioners were materially assisted by
the formation of the South Australian Company, due mainly to the
exertions of Mr. G. F. Angas.</p>

<p>“Under all circumstances, however, the early surveying of the land
was very important; while, at the same time, economy restricted the
choice of surveyors mainly to those embarking in the enterprise on
other grounds. The selection having been made, however, and the
staff sent out, we hoped for the best; but disappointment followed.
The survey made slow progress, and demands came home for such
an increase of force as in that early stage would have swamped the
whole enterprise. These, fortunately, my previous practice in surveying
enabled me successfully to oppose; but it was not until a
new chief surveyor had been sent out, in the person of Lieutenant
(now General) Frome, R.E., and a new governor with ampler powers
than his predecessor, that matters were at length put right.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>“The payments to ship-owners and ship-surgeons were regulated
by the number of emigrants conveyed; but as the occurrence of
births and deaths produced considerable variation during the
voyage, it became important to determine at what period the
number should be ascertained. I advised that this should be done,
not, as was customary, at the beginning of the voyage, but at its
close, so as to supply a strong motive to the maintenance of the
general health aboard ship. This plan being adopted answered so
well, that the number that arrived in the colony often exceeded
that recorded at departure; the births on board having outnumbered
the deaths. Not thinking it well, however, to trust entirely to this
arrangement, I took, under authority of the Commissioners, every
care to have both ship and provisions effectually surveyed. On both
points a controversy frequently occurred which it may be well to
mention. I always took care that the requirements authorised by
the Commissioners should be emphatically urged on the attention of
the contractors, and constantly received assurance that they were
fully understood, and should be fully acted upon; but when defects
and blemishes were brought to light by the accuracy of the survey,
and the stipulated consequences enforced, an outcry arose, as if the
connection between promise and performance were an unheard-of
and most unwarrantable innovation. After a time, however, as our
practice became recognised, evasive attempts grew rare, the first
expense being found to be the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Another difficulty arose from unpunctuality in time of sailing,
the ships chartered to convey emigrants being too often unprepared
when the appointed day arrived. The first means adopted to obtain
punctuality was to stipulate for fines in case of delay; but the
artificial nature of this arrangement rendered its maintenance difficult.
Excuses were tendered, often plausible, sometimes substantial,
so that their rejection was hard, while at the same time, whether the
penalty were enforced or remitted, the passengers by the particular
ship suffered all the inconvenience of delay. To remedy these evils,
the rule now established was, that whenever the day for sailing
arrived, whether the vessel were ready or not, the expense of
boarding and maintaining the emigrants was to be borne by the ship-owners.
This gave such a motive to punctuality that delay became
infrequent, while, at the worst, detained passengers were relieved
from all loss save that of time. I may add that the combined effect
of our precautions was that no emigrant ship was lost, nor even
sustained any serious accident.</p>

<p>“Yet further to expedite the despatch of emigrants, I procured one
additional arrangement. At this early period the sailing of chartered
ships being but monthly, the interval was inconveniently long; so
that persons who had made up their minds to emigrate were often
kept for two or three weeks in that unsettled state which inevitably
precedes a great removal. To furnish intermediate opportunity, I
induced the Commissioners to give notice to ship-owners that if they
were willing to submit to the conditions imposed on vessels chartered
by the Commissioners, at the same time undertaking the conveyance
at the lowest rate yet tendered and accepted, any unappropriated
space should be occupied, in whole or in part, by such emigrants as
might be on hand.</p>

<p>“In short, the whole scheme—in which, however, I must admit
that my share was but subordinate—worked so well that in the year
when I withdrew from my connection with the colony, though this
was only the fourth year of the despatch of settlers, the sales of land
produced as much as £170,000, the number of chartered ships
being thirty-eight, and that of emigrants upwards of five thousand.</p>

<p>“Subsequently, indeed, difficulties arose, serious indications of
which had appeared before I ceased to be secretary. The expenditure
in the colony, notwithstanding every precaution taken at home,
had begun to exceed the authorised estimates, and this eventually
compelled the Commissioners to seek aid from the Government;
the consequence being that the management of the colony was in
effect transferred to the Colonial Office. The debt, however, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
contracted was, I believe, subsequently discharged, and if so, the
colony may fairly be said to have been from the first self-supporting,
being certainly the first, and perhaps the only, colony that could
claim that honour.</p>

<p>“As regards the political system of the colony, I may be allowed
to mention that when the Commissioners, in their third annual
report, recommended Government to grant it municipal institutions,
the recommendation included at my suggestion the plan<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> which has
been already spoken of<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> as devised by my father many years before,
and has recently been more known to the world in connection with
the name of Mr. Hare. This plan was adopted at the time, though
abandoned at a later period.</p>

<p>“As this secretaryship was my first public employment, and as
the estimation in which I was held at its close was important, if not
essential to my subsequent course, I may, perhaps, be pardoned if I
give here the letter in which my resignation was acknowledged, and
my services referred to. I have only to add that, heavy as were my
duties during the four years of my secretaryship, and the year or
two that preceded my formal appointment to that post, I was also
engaged, throughout the whole period, at one or other of two
arduous undertakings. Of the former I shall speak presently; the
latter was Postal reform; my facts being collected, my plan devised,
my pamphlet written, and my case established before a parliamentary
committee, more than a year before I left my post.</p>

</div>

<p>“The former of my two interludes—if I may so style a piece of
downright hard work—was an improvement of the printing machine,
which I took in hand when it yet seemed doubtful whether the
South Australian enterprise would yield me an income. My attention
to the subject of printing, I may here observe, arose from my
connection with the Useful Knowledge Society, then so actively
engaged in promoting and cheapening popular literature.</p>

<p>“Every one knows that about twenty years before this period the
process of printing, at least in the largest offices, had been almost
revolutionized by the admirable machine invented in great part by
the late Mr. Edward Cowper, afterwards Professor Cowper of King’s
College, London; with whom, I may add, I became acquainted
about this time, and whom to know was to regard and esteem. At
the time when I turned my thoughts earnestly to the subject, the
machines then in use (for by this time great improvements had been
made in the original invention, partly by Mr. Cowper himself, partly
by others, particularly by Mr. Applegarth), could throw off in the
hour, instead of the two hundred and fifty single impressions, to
which the Stanhope press, the best in previous use, was limited,
eight hundred sheets thoroughly well printed on both sides, or four
thousand of such quality as was admissible in newspapers, printed
on one side.</p>

<p>“Meantime, however, an important improvement had been made
in the manufacture of paper, viz., that of Fourdrinier; and it
occurred to me that advantage might be taken of this to construct a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
printing machine capable of working at much higher speed. By
Fourdrinier’s machine, as is well known, paper is produced, not in
single sheets, as by the former mode, but in long scrolls, capable, I
believe, of almost indefinite extension; and I perceived that by their
use, one, and probably the only insuperable obstacle to a rotatory
machine, was removed. I perceived also that such machine would
have a double advantage; its greater speed being produced by a far
smaller expenditure of power.</p>

<p>“The difficulties to be surmounted, however, were neither small
nor few. The plan implied the necessity of attaching the types to a
roller; which, again, involved a change in their form, and also
devices to keep them firmly in place against the combined power of
gravity and what is called, or rather miscalled, centrifugal force.
Another difficulty regarded the supply and proper distribution of the
ink, for which no interval could be left, as the process of printing off
was to be absolutely continuous. As my invention was not practically
adopted, and has been in a great measure superseded by later
improvements, I forbear details, referring the curious either to my
specification, which is dated August 12th, 1835, and numbered
6762; a printed copy of which may be procured at the Patent
Office, or to the ‘Repertory of Patent Inventions,’ No. 35, where
the machine is accurately and lucidly described.</p>

<p>“It is but just to record, that in giving my invention a practical
shape, I was constantly and ably assisted by my brother Edwin, who,
I may here add, afterwards became known as the originator of the
machine for folding envelopes, which attracted so much attention at
the Great Exhibition of 1851. Many of the minor parts, essential,
however, to the efficient working of our printing machine, were of
his device and construction, and in my necessary absence the work
proceeded under his superintendence.</p>

<p>“At length, as is already implied, the machine was completed,
and the patent secured. Its operation was repeatedly shown to
members of the trade and others interested in the matter; the work
produced, though at high speed, being pronounced beautiful, and
that which is technically called the register accurate perhaps beyond
parallel, while its action was so rapid that even when worked by
hand it threw off double impressions of the size of the <i>Globe</i>
newspaper at the rate of eight thousand per hour, or nearly ten-fold
the number produced at the same time by the reciprocating machine;
nay, more, during this very process it could concurrently throw off
eight thousand single impressions from each of its two rollers; thus
making up thirty-two thousand single impressions in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“It remains to be explained why the invention never came into
general use.”</p>

</div>

<p>[It was Sir Rowland Hill’s wish that the passage which
next followed in the Prefatory Memoir should be enlarged.
He was not well enough himself to make the additions which
he desired, but he supplied his son, Mr. Pearson Hill, with
the necessary information and documents. After suggesting
in a manuscript marginal note the changes which should be
made, he added: “I leave this in my son’s hands, who will
best know how to deal with it.” Mr. Pearson Hill has
accordingly supplied me with the following statement:—]</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The practical difficulties to the employment of the machine
for the printing of newspapers—the work for which it was especially
fitted—were all in a fair way of being removed. A provisional
contract, which is still in our possession, had even been entered
into with certain parties to provide my father with the means of
rapidly casting curved stereotype plates, similar to those now
used for printing newspapers, when he found himself face to face
with what proved an insuperable difficulty on the part of the Stamp
Office.</p>

<p>“In those days, and indeed for many years after, newspapers
were charged with Stamp Duty. By the requirements of the
Inland Revenue Department, every separate sheet on which a
newspaper was printed had to bear an impressed stamp—the
separate sheets being sent to the Stamp Office to be so impressed,
and then returned to the various newspaper printing offices ready
for use.</p>

<p>“This necessity for cutting the paper into separate sheets before
printing, of course, was absolutely inconsistent with printing the
newspaper from a continuous scroll. My father applied, therefore,
to the Treasury to make arrangements to allow the stamp to be
affixed by machinery as the scroll passed through the press (as was
indeed done years afterwards), but his request was refused.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This
decision on the part of the Treasury deferred for something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
five-and-thirty years the introduction of the present rotatory printing-press.</p>

<p>“The following is a copy of his memorial to the Treasury, and
of the answer that he received:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Right Honorable the Chancellor of the Exchequer</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Memorial of</p>

<p class="center">ROWLAND HILL.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sheweth,</p>

<p>That your Memorialist has recently obtained His Majesty’s
Letters Patent for certain improvements in the method of letter-press
printing by machinery, the object of which improvements,
besides considerable economy, is a very greatly increased speed
in the printing of newspapers, but which object cannot be fully
realized unless a change can be permitted in the manner of impressing
the Government Stamp upon the newspapers printed by his
machines, inasmuch as it is an important part of his plan to make
use of the paper, not in separate sheets but in very long scrolls,
<i>i.e.</i>, in the state it is first produced by the modern paper-making
machines, each long scroll as it passes rapidly through the printing-machine
receiving a series of repetitions of the letter-press.</p>

<p class="noindent">Further that</p>

<p class="center">Your Memorialist’s</p>

<p class="noindent">apparatus is so constructed that one complete impression, and no
more, is produced by one revolution of the machine, since the types
necessary to the printing of a complete impression are arranged
around a cylinder, whose surface is by the said types, with the
addition of proper marginal spaces, wholly covered, so that each
revolution of this cylinder gives exactly one impression.</p>

<p class="noindent">Also</p>

<p>That the Government Stamp could readily be attached to
the printing cylinder of your Memorialist’s machine, so that each
revolution of the cylinder giving an impression of the type, should
necessarily give an impression of the Stamp also; and that there
are contrivances well known to machinists, and extensively used
by them, by which the number of turns made by a machine can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
be recorded without chance of error or possibility of fraud. The
Gas Meter is the most familiar instance, and upon its accuracy the
Gas Companies stake their important interests without doubt or
hesitation.</p>

<p class="noindent">That</p>

<p>Under these circumstances your Memorialist ventures to
hope that in the Bill now before Parliament for the consolidation
of the Stamp Acts, a power may be given to the Commissioners
of Stamps to make such arrangements as they may deem advisable
for affording to your Memorialist and to the Public the advantages
which the use of his improved printing machine offers.</p>

<p>Your Memorialist takes the liberty to enclose the draft of a clause
for consideration.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Copy of Enclosure.</span></p>

<p>178.—And whereas it is expedient that no obstacle should be
presented to the introduction of improvements in machinery for
printing newspapers; and that to this end it is desirable that a
provision should be made for allowing newspaper stamps to be
affixed to the paper before it is cut up into separate sheets: Be
it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for any printer of newspapers
to stamp his own paper (either as it passes through the
printing machine, or in such other way as he may prefer), provided
he can satisfy the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes that no
danger of a fraud on the Revenue will arise in his case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Having laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s
Treasury your Memorial praying that a Clause may be inserted into
the New Stamp Bill, allowing the printers of newspapers themselves
to impress the necessary Stamps on their papers, I am directed to
acquaint you that My Lords cannot comply with your request.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,</p>

<p>“It may not be without interest to the public to show how easily
‘insuperable’ official objections can be overcome, when those who
raise them desire it. Many years afterwards, when the proprietors
of a London newspaper were making improvements in their printing
machinery, and required the very facility for which my father had vainly
contended, the Board of Inland Revenue, as I am told, on looking
into the Act of Parliament on the matter, found that though the
printing of the impressed stamp at the same time as the rest of the
newspaper was clearly illegal, the only parties who could proceed
against any newspaper proprietor so offending were the Commissioners
of Inland Revenue themselves. Now as the Commissioners
had made up their minds to allow the change, not only was an
intimation given to the proprietors of the newspaper in question
that they would not be interfered with, but the officers of the Stamp
Office—Mr. Edwin Hill especially—gave most valuable assistance in
devising the means of carrying out the improved (though decidedly
illegal) arrangement.</p>

<p>“I may add that at the Caxton Exhibition in 1877, a copy of
my father’s patent, as well as a type cylinder, inking apparatus, and
such other portions of his printing machine as, after a lapse of
forty-two years, could be got together, were exhibited, and are now
to be seen by any one interested in the matter in the South Kensington
Museum.”</p>

</div>

<p>[Though the employment of his printing machine for
newspaper work was rendered impossible by the obstacle
described above, it might still have been available for other
purposes, had he been able to give it his attention. He thus
continues his narrative:—]</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was about this time that I began to entertain distinct hopes,
however slight as yet their foundation, of employment in relation to
postal affairs; and as usual in cases of great difficulty, I consulted
my father and my brothers on the subject of future proceedings. I
represented that I found myself unable to continue my duties in
relation to the Australian Commission, and, at the same time, both
to take effectual means for establishing the success of the printing
machine, and to labour efficiently at my project for postal reform.
Here was grave matter for consideration, the invention having
already cost a large amount of labour, spread over a whole year,
from both my brother and myself, besides £2,000 in hard cash;
while, on the other hand, postal prospects, in which every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
present took a deep interest, all having indeed already laboured with
me in the cause, were regarded as promising. It was inquired
whether my brother, who had thus far assisted me in the printing
machine, could not himself carry the matter to completion; but
unhappily his health was at that time in too depressed a state to
leave any hope that he could alone surmount obstacles so formidable.
Here I may remark that, at one time or other, every member of our
family has fallen, at least once in his life, through excessive labour
and anxiety, into severe, protracted, and even dangerous illness—illness
involving consequences which nothing but our unshaken
union could have enabled us to support. After long and careful
consideration, they concurred in advising that the Post Office should
be preferred to the printing machine; and as this recommendation
seconded my own opinion, I decided to act upon it.</p>

<p>“I have only to say, in conclusion, that a printer of the highest
standing in his trade, induced, I suppose, partly by what I had done
in this matter, partly by a general knowledge of my antecedents,
offered me in 1839 a very advantageous partnership,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> which I should
certainly have accepted, but that it would have involved my refusal
of the offer which Government had just then made me, viz., of a
post in the Treasury for the prosecution of my plan of postal
reform.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>[This account of Rowland Hill’s printing-press may be
well brought to an end by the following extract from a letter
which he wrote to his wife on July 17th, 1835:—]</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have a good account to give of the printing machine. We
have now completed the single machine, and the night before last
we gave it a trial. It worked better than I hoped even, and fully
established, I think, the correctness of the views we have entertained.
Miss D——, who left for Birmingham this morning, has
taken with her the scroll of paper which was printed.... It
will be forwarded to you. I need not ask you to take care of it,
and to return it when you come back to me. Some day or other
it may be a great curiosity.”</p>

<h3 id="PREFACE">PREFACE TO THE HISTORY OF PENNY POSTAGE.</h3>

<p>The following narrative was originally drawn up at
much greater length, and in its present shape is
the result of a double abridgment, first in manuscript
and afterwards in print. This proceeding
was according to a preconceived plan; my wish
being to leave to my relatives a more detailed
history than was likely to be acceptable to the
public, and at the same time to supply ample
means for dealing with any question that might
arise as to accuracy of statement.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be thought that abridgment might
have been advantageously carried yet further; but,
on the one hand, I hope there is at present no
more superfluous matter than can be readily skipt;
and, on the other, I naturally desired that the
public should have so much of detail as would
distinctly set forth the authorship, execution, and
administration of the chief Postal Reforms effected
during the last thirty years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
My story is told in the first person; but it is
only in a limited sense that it is autobiographic.
For reasons that will be easily gathered from the
narrative, I had to devolve upon another the task of
immediate composition, and I deemed it fortunate
that one upon whose pen I had much relied from
the first, had leisure for the work. This, I may
remark, is much more vicarious in the narrative
presented to the public than in the original, where
events are to a great extent described in letters or in
extracts from my Journal. Of course the whole has
undergone my careful revision, a duty in which I
have been by no means unaided; but, after every
correction, I cannot feel sure that sense has not
sometimes suffered in paraphrase; and if it appear
hereafter that on some minor points expression
conveys or suggests erroneous meaning, I must ask
the reader to believe that such deviation is not
only contrary to my intention and sincere desire,
but has occurred in spite of our earnest efforts.</p>

<p>If the reader find somewhat too much of self-assertion—if
he think I have too often quoted what
is complimentary to myself—I ask him to consider
how much I have suffered from detraction and injustice;
how my conclusions were ridiculed, my
success denied; and how, when success was incontestable,
the origination of my plan was claimed
by others. Let him see me dismissed from office,
without recompense, by a man of Sir Robert Peel’s
high character, and consider the presumption naturally
arising from an act so unusual; let him observe how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
long and pertinaciously the progress of Postal Reform
was troubled and thwarted, and how loudly and
confidently I was charged with proceedings for which
I of all men was farthest from being responsible.
He will readily be aware that claims and accusations
may revive when I am no more; and will perhaps
pardon me if, with all the reserve adverted to above,
I am still led by precaution into what he may regard
as prolixity.</p>

<p>One point more. If it be asked why I do not
yet publish this history, so as to enable me to meet
in my own person any controversy to which it may
give rise, I answer—first, that by the time of its
completion my vigour, both of body and mind, had
become so impaired, as to put such direct defence,
should it be needed, altogether beyond my power;
and, secondly, that I hope and trust the delay of a
few years may enable my executors, while retaining
all statements essential to the completeness of the
narrative, so to place it before the public as to avoid
wounding the feelings of any one.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONCEPTION OF MY PLAN. CHIEFLY 1836.</span></h3>

<p>Amongst the many subjects which casually attracted
the attention of our family, the operations of the Post
Office naturally took their turn. My father spoke at
times of Palmer’s great improvement,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which he well
remembered, and mentioned its beneficial results.
Postal considerations, moreover, came upon us in a
very practical form; every day that brought post-letters
brought also a demand for payment, the postman
waiting at the door till he had received his
money. In the very early period, when we were
most straitened in means, his rap was not always
welcome; the demand being certain and sometimes
inconvenient; the recompense, in the way of news,
doubtful. Tradesmen’s circulars, in particular, which
sometimes came from a considerable distance, and
always unpaid, were great causes of disappointment
and irritation. Happily they were but rare in those
days, or the evil would have been intolerable.</p>

<p>As much more than half the present generation have
had no experience of any other system than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
penny postage, it must be difficult, if not impracticable,
to give an adequate conception of the state of things
at the time referred to, of the height and variety of
rates charged, and of the multitudinous shifts resorted
to for their evasion. The law gave the Post Office
a monopoly, and respect for the law is considered
characteristic of our countrymen; but, to the best of
my memory, I never knew of any one being withheld
from its breach on this point, save by considerations
either of convenience or of prudence.</p>

<p>The following facts are given by way of example:
If, when residing at Birmingham, we received a letter
from London, the lowest charge was ninepence, while
the slightest enclosure raised it to eighteenpence, and
a second enclosure to two shillings and threepence,
though the whole missive might not weigh a quarter
of an ounce. We had relatives at Haddington; the
lowest rate thence was thirteenpence-halfpenny; others
at Shrewsbury, but the postage thence I do not remember,
as we never used the Post Office in our
correspondence with them, since a tradesman in our
town who had occasion to send and, in turn, to receive
a weekly packet, was kind enough to enclose our
letters, we carrying them more than half a mile to
place them in his hands, while the return letters,
being dropped by him into the Birmingham Post
Office, came to us charged with merely the local rate
of one penny. In looking over letters of the period
antecedent to the Post Office reform, I find constant
reference to expedients for saving postage; thus, in
writing to a friend at a particular town, we would
trouble him to call upon such and such others to communicate
intelligence, or to make inquiries, the result
to be reported in his next letter; sometimes, even, we
would ask him to call upon tradesmen to give orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
or to urge despatch in commissions previously given.
If a friend were about to make a journey to a town
where we had connections, we did not hesitate to place
letters in his hands, regardless alike of his trouble
and the chance of his forgetfulness; being ourselves,
of course, ready in turn to perform the like service.
In the year 1823, taking a holiday excursion through
the lake district<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> to Scotland, and wishing to keep my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
family informed as to my movements and my health
(then in a depressed state), I carried with me a number
of old newspapers, and in franking these, according to
the useless form then required, while I left the postmark
with its date to show the place, I indicated my
state of health by selecting names according to previous
arrangement; the more Liberal members being taken
to indicate that I was better, while Tories were to
show that I was falling back; “Sir Francis Burdett”
was to imply vigorous health, while probably “Lord
Eldon” would almost have brought one of my brothers
after me in anxiety and alarm.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In later days, more
especially after our removal to the neighbourhood of
London, and most of all while my eldest brother was in
Parliament, we sometimes procured franks, particularly
when for any reason we had unusual regard to
appearances; but as at that time we were in easier
circumstances, we felt some compunction in using
franks for general purposes, thinking it questionable to
evade an impost by the use of means from which, as
we well knew by earlier experience, those lower down
were utterly debarred. This feeling became stronger
as we learnt the monstrous abuses which had grown
up in connection with the franking system; when we
found, for instance, that though a member’s frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
would cover but an ounce, there were franks of another
kind which served for unlimited weight, and were
said to have been actually used to free a greatcoat,
a bundle of baby-linen, and a pianoforte.</p>

<p>Even in our early days, however, necessity being
the mother of conception as well as of invention, my
father, while testifying great admiration for the postal
system generally, had repeatedly expressed the opinion
that, even for fiscal purposes, postage was unwisely
high, an opinion which in all probability tended to
draw my attention to postal affairs. Be this as it may,
the earliest record on the subject that I can find in my
memoranda, and which is dated August, 1826 (that is,
ten years before the publication of my pamphlet),
gives my first conception of a travelling post office.
It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The mails reach London at six in the morning, and the
distribution of letters does not commence till after nine. Might
not the mails arrive three hours later, and consequently leave the
respective towns three hours later, if the letters could be assorted and
marked on the road? And might not this be done by the guard, if
he had the inside fitted up with shelves, &amp;c., for the purpose?
The charge for postage might be marked with a stamp; as each bag
was received, all the London letters it contained would require the
same stamp-mark, except in cases of double and treble letters, when
the mark might be repeated. If, from any defects in the address,
the guard should not be able to assign any letter to its proper
district, he might put it by for assortment at the General Post Office,
to be delivered the next day.... An additional body might be
added to the coach for inside passengers, or, the load being less,
two of the horses might perhaps be spared, which would enable
the speed to be increased (as with a proportionate load two will
go quicker than four horses), and would save time in changing
them.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a yet earlier date than this, however, though
how many years before I do not know, I had given
some little thought to the subject of more rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
locomotion; having mainly in view, I believe, the
speedier conveyance of the mail. I had considered,
as well as some others, the question of propulsion by
steam, being of course entirely unaware of the great
invention then progressing in the mind of George
Stephenson; and, indeed, having no notion that the
laying of a railway would be a necessary preliminary.
Steam, however, I soon abandoned for a more potent
as well as more portable agent, viz., gunpowder;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and
with this I made some experiments; but these proving
unsatisfactory, I carried my researches no further, and
so escaped, perhaps, a serious explosion. My next
memorandum bears date January 11th, 1830, and
suggests the feasibility of conveying the mails through
tubes by atmospheric means; but this, also, remained
a crude and unpublished conception.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that our opinion was
from first to last, and without reserve or exception,
in favour of free trade. Such being our views, we had
welcomed with joy the gradual relaxation of the
protective system, which, commencing under Mr.
Huskisson, never absolutely stopped until protection
was no more. We had remarked, with satisfaction,
that the lowering of the tariff had not produced a
corresponding reduction in the public revenue; and we
indulged in sanguine hopes that, even where reduction
appeared in a particular department, it either would be
temporary or would be made up in some other.</p>

<p>The year 1835 having brought a large surplus in
the general revenue, we naturally speculated as to its
application in the reduction of duties;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and it was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that my thoughts first turned earnestly to the Post
Office. I now examined more in detail the result of
the late financial reforms: and I found (as subsequently
stated in my pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>) that in the reductions hitherto
made, the relation between the relief to the public
and the loss to the revenue had varied greatly; so
that, while in the instance of leather and soap the
reduction of one half of the duty had eventually
caused to the revenue a loss of one third, in that of
coffee the same reduction had actually produced a
gain of one half. This brought me to the conclusion
that, “when a reduction of taxation is about to take
place, it is exceedingly important that great care and
judgment should be exercised in the selection of the
tax to be reduced, in order that the maximum of relief
may be afforded to the public with the minimum of
injury to the revenue.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>My next attempt was to arrive at some rule which
might serve for general guidance in such cases; and
I came to the conclusion that, with some allowance
for exceptions, the best test would be found by examining
each tax “as to whether its productiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
has kept pace with the increasing number and prosperity
of the nation. And the tax which proves most
defective under this test is in all probability the one we
are now in quest of.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>This test brought the tax I had in mind, viz., that
on the transmission of letters, into bad pre-eminence;
since, during the previous twenty years, viz., from
1815 to 1835 (my investigations being made in 1836),
the absolute revenue derived from the Post Office,
whether gross or net, instead of increasing, had even
somewhat diminished; whereas, if it had merely kept
pace with the growth of population, to say nothing of
the concurrent spread of education, extension of trade,
and advancement in prosperity, the revenue—I mean
the net revenue—would have increased by no less
than £500,000.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>To try the matter further, I looked out for some
other tax, which, while less exorbitant, was in other
respects liable to as nearly as possible the same
influences, and I naturally took the duty on stage-coaches.
I found that the amount yielded by this,
instead of diminishing, like that in question, had more
than doubled in the same period; increasing from
less than £218,000 to nearly £500,000, or about
one hundred and twenty-eight per cent. I found,
again, that if the Post Office revenue had risen in
like proportion (and it seemed scarcely to be doubted
that the demand for the conveyance of letters had
increased in the same ratio as that for the conveyance
of persons and parcels), the increase of net
revenue would have been no less than £2,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The general fairness of this conclusion was afterwards
shown by the fact; 116 per cent. having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the ratio of increase in the net revenue of the Post
Office during the twenty years between 1847 and
1867.</p>

<p>For yet further comparison, I turned to the accounts
of the Post Office revenue in France, where the rates of
postage were less exorbitant than with us, and taking
the gross revenue (the net revenue not being given),
I found that this had risen from somewhat less than
£1,000,000 in 1821 to nearly £1,500,000 in 1835,
about fifty-four per cent. in fourteen years.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Nor was I proceeding without authority in thus
condemning the existing postal rates as unsound in
policy, Sir Henry Parnell having attributed the non-increase
of the revenue to the high duty charged on
letters; while Mr. McCulloch had not only taken the
same general view, but attributed the loss to the
illicit conveyance of letters, for which the increased
number of coaches gave so much facility.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Of the
important services of Mr. Wallace in elucidating the
same point I shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>While thus confirmed in my belief that, even from a
financial point of view, the postal rates were injuriously
high, I also became more and more convinced, the
more I considered the question, that the fiscal loss was
not the most serious injury thus inflicted on the public;
that yet more serious evil resulted from the obstruction
thus raised to the moral and intellectual progress of
the people; and that the Post Office, if put on a sound
footing, would assume the new and important character
of a powerful engine of civilisation; that though now
rendered feeble and inefficient by erroneous financial
arrangements, it was capable of performing a distinguished
part in the great work of national education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
I became also more alive to the consideration that
the duty of rendering its operation as beneficial as
possible, incumbent as this must be on any institution,
became doubly so on the Post Office, from its
being a monopoly; that, as it forbade all others to
perform its functions, it was bound to render its own
performance as complete as possible.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Of this view
I found strong confirmation in the recent report of a
Government Commission.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Being thus fully convinced that the present arrangements
were wrong, I had next to inquire as to the
changes most effectual for redress. As I had never
yet been within the walls of any Post Office<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> (an advantage
which was, indeed, reserved for me until after
the adoption of my plan), my only sources of information,
for the time, consisted in those heavy blue
books, in which invaluable matter too often lies hidden
amidst heaps of rubbish. Into some of these, as previously
implied, I had already dipped; but Mr. Wallace
having supplied me by post with an additional half
hundred weight of raw material, I now commenced
that systematic study, analysis, and comparison, which
the difficulty of my self-imposed task rendered necessary.</p>

<p>I started, however, with the simple notion that rates
must be reduced,—but soon came to the conclusion
that such reduction might be carried to a considerable
extent not only without loss to the revenue, but with
positive benefit; that a larger reduction might be
made without loss, and a still larger without drawing
upon the surplus beyond a reasonable extent.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
question to be decided therefore was, how far the total
reduction might safely be carried; and this involved
two preliminary inquiries; first, what would be the
probable increase of correspondence consequent upon
such or such reduction; secondly, what would be the
augmentation of expense consequent upon such increase.</p>

<p>Investigation upon this latter head brought out
three important facts. The first was that one great
source of expense was to be found in what is technically
called “taxing” the letters, that is, ascertaining
and marking the postage to be charged on each; the
second, that great expense likewise arose from complicated
accounts, postmasters having to be debited with
unpaid postage on letters transmitted to their offices,
and credited with their payments made in return;
while they again had to receive and check the payments
of the letter carriers, who, it must be remembered,
received, at that time, from the public, almost
all the postage paid; the third, that the cost of delivering
letters, great as it inevitably was, was much
augmented—indeed, save in rural districts, more than
doubled—by being saddled with the collection of
postage. It further appeared that these expenses
must increase in something like direct proportion to
increase in the number of letters.</p>

<p>These conclusions led me to perceive that for the
effectual reduction of expense it was necessary to
obtain simplicity of operation, and therefore to reduce
the prodigious variety of rates (then extending, on
single inland letters alone, to upwards of forty), and
further, to adopt means to induce prepayment, so as
to save the time at once of the letter carriers, of the
clerks with whom they had to account for postage
received, of the provincial postmasters, and, lastly, of
the clerks at the central office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering how far the variety of rates might be
reduced, I was naturally led to inquire what proportion
of postal expense proceeded from the conveyance of
letters between town and town, and further, how far
such expense, whatever it might be, varied in relation
to distance. On pursuing this inquiry, I arrived at
results so startling that nothing but the most careful
verification could satisfy me of their accuracy. I first
perceived that the expense of such conveyance, which
one would naturally suppose to be very great, was
in fact, when divided by the number of missives, very
small.</p>

<p>Having, according to the best information then
accessible, estimated the number of letters and newspapers
annually passing through the Post Office at
126,000,000, I calculated the apparent cost of what I
termed the primary distribution, viz., the receipt, conveyance
and distribution of missives passing from post
town to post town, and found that this cost, on all such
letters, newspapers, &amp;c., within the United Kingdom,
was, on the average, only 84-hundredths of a penny
each; and that of this sum only one-third, or 28-hundredths
of a penny went to conveyance; the
remaining two-thirds, or 56-hundredths of a penny,
appertaining to the receipt and delivery of letters,
the collection of postage, &amp;c. I further remarked
that, as the cost of conveyance for a given distance
is, under ordinary circumstances, in tolerably direct
proportion to the weight carried, and as a newspaper
or franked letter (and franked letters were then very
numerous) weighs generally as much as several ordinary
letters, the average expense of conveying a letter
chargeable with postage must be much lower yet;
probably about one-third of the sum mentioned above,
or, in other words, nine-hundredths of a penny; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
conclusion pretty well supported by the acknowledged
fact that the chargeable letters did not weigh more
than about one-fourth of the whole mail.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Beyond
this, I found, by another calculation, based on
more exact data, that the cost of transit as regards
the great mass of letters, small as it appeared to be,
was in reality still smaller; being probably loaded with
charges not strictly appertaining to it, and certainly
enhanced by the carriage of the mail to places which
were “not of sufficient importance to repay the expense.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Having found, with tolerable accuracy, the total cost
of conveying the mail from London to Edinburgh;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
having in like manner estimated the weight of the
mail so conveyed, and from these premises deduced
the cost per letter, I found this to be no more than
one thirty-sixth part of a penny, though the distance,
four hundred miles, is far above the average.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Thus, then, I found, first, that the cost of conveying
a letter between post town and post town was exceedingly
small; secondly, that it had but little relation to
distance; and thirdly, that it depended much upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
number of letters conveyed by the particular mail; and
as the cost per letter would diminish with every increase
in such number, and as such increase would
certainly follow reduction of postage, it followed that,
if a great reduction could be effected, the cost of conveyance,
per letter, already so small, might be deemed
absolutely insignificant.</p>

<p>Hence, then, I came to the important conclusion
that the existing practice of regulating the amount of
postage by the distance over which an inland letter
was conveyed, however plausible in appearance, had
no foundation in principle; and that consequently the
rates of postage should be irrespective of distance. I
scarcely need add that this discovery, as startling to
myself as it could be to any one else, was the basis of
the plan which has made so great a change in postal
affairs.</p>

<p>New prospects having thus opened upon me, I was
next led to consider two further questions, both important
to that simplicity of arrangement of which I
was in quest.</p>

<p>First, was it possible that the existing variable
charge should be exchanged for a single uniform rate?</p>

<p>Second, was it practicable to require prepayment?</p>

<p>No great sagacity was needful to perceive how vast
would be the convenience to the public, and the economy
of labour to the Post Office, if either of these
points could be secured, and how prodigious the gain
from attaining both.</p>

<p>As regards the first, it was clear that as the expenses
of the receipt and delivery were the same for
all letters, while the cost of conveyance, already so
small, seemed reducible to absolute insignificance, a
uniform rate would approach nearer to absolute justice
than any other rate that could be fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It further appeared that as lowness of rate was
essential to uniformity (since no serious elevation of
the lowest existing rates would be tolerated, and the
same lowness was the only condition on which prepayment
could be successfully required) every reduction
of working expenses, however obtained, would
itself, by facilitating decrease of rate, become a means
of attaining the simplicity indispensable to my plan.</p>

<p>Seeing that there would be great difficulty in establishing
any uniform rate higher than the minimum
then in use, viz., one penny, I was of course led to
consider whether the uniform rate could be fixed as
low as that small sum; or, in other words, what loss of
net revenue would be involved in the adoption of a
penny rate; and next, whether such loss would be admissible
for the sake of the great advantages to be thereby
secured.</p>

<p>Again, however, perceiving that though simple
distance did not justify increase of rate, yet such
increase might be required by remoteness from the
great highways of traffic, I thought that probably
general uniformity might be more easily secured by
sacrificing universality; and hence arose my conception,
now doubtless generally forgotten, of a practical
distinction between primary and secondary distribution.
By primary distribution, I meant the transmission of
letters, &amp;c., from post town to post town throughout
the United Kingdom, and the delivery within the post
towns; and by secondary distribution, that distribution
which proceeds from each post town, as a centre, to
places of inferior importance;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> my plan being that
within the range of primary distribution there should
be a uniform rate of one penny, retaining an additional
charge for secondary distribution (to be collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on delivery), unless, indeed, any district so served
might choose to take the cost of such distribution
upon itself.</p>

<p>Of the equity of such a distinction it is needless to
speak, since the difference of charge would have proceeded
from a difference in actual expense; of its
feasibility it is enough to say that it was to a considerable
extent in actual use, the common practice being,
on the arrival of a letter at any post town, for delivery
beyond a certain range, to charge an additional penny.
In one instance at least the existing difference was yet
greater, the additional charge in the London district
being as high as twopence. In some towns in each of
the three kingdoms the secondary principle was carried
so far as to impose a special charge, generally of a
penny, on all letters not fetched from the office by the
receiver;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> a practice continued, I believe, for some
time even after the establishment of penny postage.
The only remaining question was whether, supposing
this distinction to be set aside, the advantage of
absolute uniformity would compensate for the injustice
involved in establishing equality of charge with inequality
of expense.</p>

<p>At the same time, wishing to give primary distribution
its greatest possible range, and to make the
rates even on secondary distribution as low as could
fairly be done, I proposed that the whole weight of
taxation should be thrown on the primary distribution,
which was to include every place which could be
reached without absolute loss to the revenue, and that
each department of the secondary distribution should
just defray its own expenses.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> On this plan I
hoped that, under economical management, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
important village would be able to obtain at least
one delivery per day, and the importance of such
extension will be strikingly manifest when the
reader is reminded that at the period in question
there were, even in England proper, districts as large
as the county of Middlesex in which the postman
never set foot.</p>

<p>Upon looking back to this question as it then stood,
I am inclined to think that the early abandonment of
this distinction (made for reasons that will appear
hereafter) was on several accounts unfortunate; one
serious consequence being a great aggravation of the
immediate loss to the revenue, but a far more important
one its effect in retarding that extension of
postal facilities of which I have yet to speak, and
which was so important both to public convenience
and fiscal recovery. As the additional charge would
have repaid the cost of extension, the most ostensible
as well as the most valid objection thereto, would have
been removed; and that development might have been
rapid which was, in fact, lamentably slow. Doubtless
the distinction would have been but temporary, save,
perhaps, in those remote places where there is now no
delivery at all; elsewhere, secondary distribution would
have gradually yielded to primary.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>One important circumstance on which I relied for
increase in the number of post letters was the extent
to which, under the stimulus of high rates, contraband
conveyance was carried. Of this I have already made
some little mention, but there was a systematic evasion
of the law that far outstripped anything that could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
done by merely private hands. I had learnt, for instance,
that the carriers plying between Birmingham
and the neighbouring towns, to the distance of twelve
or thirteen miles, were in the constant habit of conveying
letters, which they delivered at one penny each
(justifying so far my proposed reduction); and a highly
respectable merchant and manufacturer of that town
gave it me as his opinion that the number of letters so
distributed very greatly exceeded the number distributed
in the same district by the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It was
also well known that vast numbers were every day
forwarded by carriers and coach proprietors. Of course,
discoveries sometimes occurred, and penalties were
levied, but the traffic was so openly carried on that the
risk could not have been great—an occasional seizure
doing little more than show the extent of the practice,
which, indeed, was not likely to be suppressed so
long as it was sanctioned by the moral sense of the
public; in face of which the Post Office itself could
not levy its full penalties. Thus, in the year 1833,
though one of the fines incurred was as high as £1,000,
the highest amount actually paid was only £160.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Such a seizure had lately been made, bringing to light
in a carrier’s warehouse one bag containing no less than
1,100 letters.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Independently, however, of positive
evidence, it was clear that “the vast extent to which
the trade of the country had increased during the
previous twenty years” (viz., those immediately following
the close of the great war with France and the
second war with the United States) “must have been
attended by a proportionate increase in the amount
of mercantile correspondence, while the spread of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
education and increase of population during the same
period must have greatly augmented the correspondence
of all kinds.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Now it was easy to foresee (though, as will afterwards
appear, the very probability was then not merely
questioned, but denied) that the proposed reduction to
one penny would cause all, or nearly all, this correspondence
to pass through the Post Office, which, by
its superior organisation and command of means, would
render private competition on equal terms altogether
futile.</p>

<p>I have already remarked on the encouragement
afforded by the increased sale of various articles after
the reduction of the duties thereon; but perceiving that
such reduction could tend to increased sale only by its
effect on price, and that the chief element of price is
cost, over which legislation has no control, I was
naturally led to expect that here, where the reduction
would be directly and fully in the price itself, the
consequent increase of custom would be very much
greater.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>As a means of giving some indication of the results
to be looked for, I took two or three articles, of which,
from whatever cause, the price had fallen, and observed
how far cheapening had been followed by
increase in consumption. Thus, the price of soap
having fallen by one-eighth, the consumption had
increased by one-third; in tea, a reduction of one-sixth
had increased consumption by almost a half; in
coffee, a gradual reduction of one-fourth (occurring
during the previous thirteen years) had been accompanied
by an increase in consumption amounting to
three-fold;—while in cotton goods, a similar reduction
of one-half, spread over about twenty years, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
accompanied by a corresponding increase of no less
than fourfold.</p>

<p>Thus, it appeared that reduction in price, even
if it does not increase the total expenditure on the
article affected, seldom, if ever, permanently lowers
its amount.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Hence it followed that, even supposing the postage
to be reduced to the low rate contemplated, the public
would probably continue to expend as much in postage
as before; and that thus the gross revenue would be
sustained. According to my calculation, this implied
an increase in the number of letters posted to the
amount of between five- and six-fold.</p>

<p>Moreover, the soundness of the principle had already
stood the test of experiment, though on a small scale,
in the Post Office itself; the chief trial having taken
place in the London district, and considerable reductions
having also been recently made in the postage of
foreign letters, all speedily followed by great increase
in the amount of receipts therefrom. Of loss to
revenue following reduction of postage, save as a
very temporary consequence, I knew no instance.</p>

<p>In brief, I arrived at the following conclusions:—</p>

<p>First, that the number of letters passing through
the post would be greatly increased by the disuse of
franks and abandonment of illicit conveyance; by the
breaking up of one long letter into several shorter
ones, by the use of the post for the distribution of
circulars and the issue of many circulars hitherto
withheld; and, lastly, by an enormous enlargement
of the class of letter-writers.</p>

<p>Further, that supposing the public, according to its
practice in other cases, only to expend as much in
postage as before, the loss to the net revenue would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
be but small; and again, that such loss, even if large,
would be more than compensated by the powerful
stimulus given by low postage to the productive
power of the country, and the consequent increase of
revenue in other departments.</p>

<p>Finally, that while the risk to Post Office revenue
was comparatively small and the chance of eventual
gain not inconsiderable, and while the beneficial effect
on the general revenue was little less than certain,
the adoption of my plan would certainly confer a most
important, manifest, and acceptable benefit on the
country.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>It is now high time to speak of one whose valuable
services in the cause of Post Office reform are, I fear,
but insufficiently remembered at the present day, but
who, nevertheless, was in the field more than two
years before I began my investigations, and who,
while unconsciously preparing the way for my proceedings,
procured, by persevering efforts, some immediate
changes of considerable value. This was the
late Mr. Wallace, who, having been elected to the first
reformed Parliament for the new borough of Greenock,
began, in 1833, a course of bold criticism on the
proceedings of the Post Office, which, though received
at first, perhaps because of some over-earnestness, with
unmerited ridicule, gradually succeeded in obtaining
attention in Parliament, and even in some degree from
the public.</p>

<p>Up to that time the Post Office, notwithstanding its
manifold imperfections, had for a long period—perhaps
ever since the adoption of Palmer’s great reform—almost
always escaped general censure. Nor, indeed,
is this surprising; for it must be admitted that, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
far it lagged behind the knowledge of the age,
it was even then, abstractedly considered, a wonderful
machine, conveying missives to and from the most
distant places with much more approach to regularity
and certainty than any other means had yet afforded;
so that it was generally regarded in those days as an
admirable mystery, whose apparent vagaries and
shortcomings resulted, no doubt, from insuperable
difficulties well understood by the initiated, but far
beyond the comprehension of the profane vulgar. The
merit of breaking down this prestige is due in great
measure to Mr. Wallace’s exertions; for, though the
Commissioners of Revenue Inquiry, already referred
to, had a short time before with great ability exposed
much mismanagement in the Post Office, and recommended
various improvements (some of which were
afterwards taken up by Mr. Wallace, and some still later
by myself), yet these exposures and recommendations,
buried as they were in voluminous reports, attracted
little attention from the public.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, however, not contented with denouncing
abuses, proceeded to indicate various remedies;
thus, he advised the adoption of weight as
a measure of charge, instead of the absurd and troublesome
plan then in use, which regulated it mainly
by the number of enclosures. Again, he proposed
that the contract for the construction of mail-coaches
should be thrown open to public competition; a
measure which being soon afterwards adopted, effected
a saving of more than £17,000 per annum. He also
urged the consolidation of the London General and
District Post Offices; a measure which subsequently
formed part of the plan of penny postage, though not
carried into effect until many years afterwards; and,
lastly, he urged the appointment of a Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of Inquiry into the management of the Post Office; a
measure carried into effect early in 1835—the Commission
continuing its labours until 1838, during which
period it issued no less than ten reports; its efforts
fairly entitling it to the credit of much of the subsequent
improvement. During the first year of its operations
Mr. Wallace, suspending his efforts in Parliament, more
effectually served the cause to which he had devoted
himself by assisting in the investigations of the Commission;
giving evidence, in the course of which he
recommended, amongst others, the following improvements:
first, the establishment of day mails—which
subsequently formed part of my plan, and was
eventually carried into effect, with great advantage
to the public and to the revenue; secondly, a reduction
in the rates of postage; and thirdly, more frequent
communication between place and place.</p>

<p>In 1836, resuming his labours in Parliament, while
urging various other measures, he repeated his recommendation
of a reduction in the rates of postage,
naming eightpence or ninepence as a maximum (a
limitation which, whatever may be thought of it now,
would then have been regarded as a great improvement);
he advised, secondly, the registration of letters
(afterwards carried into effect with advantage both
to the public and the revenue); and lastly, the abandonment
of a rule, so monstrous that its maintenance
seems now hardly credible, by which the rate of
charge, instead of being regulated by the actual
distance between place and place (supposing distance
to be the true criterion), was varied according to the
length of the course, often very circuitous, which the
letter was made to take for the convenience of the Post
Office. It was in this year (1836) that my acquaintance
with Mr. Wallace began; but I must now return for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a time to my own proceedings, merely observing here,
though I shall have occasion to recur to the subject,
that any one wishing for a concise, but I believe
tolerably complete, statement of Mr. Wallace’s services,
may refer to the report of a speech, given in the
Appendix (F), which I made at Greenock in the year
1850, at a meeting convened for the purpose of
originating a national testimonial to Mr. Wallace, for
his services in relation to postal reform.</p>

<p>Being now prepared with my main facts and conclusions,
I had to consider how best to give them
effect. The time seemed propitious, the Liberals
being in power, the almost superstitious respect for
the Post Office being, not indeed shattered, but
certainly shaken, and a large surplus being ready to
make good the immediate loss likely to follow reduction,
as well as to provide for the moderate permanent
loss on which I had reckoned, as a proper sacrifice to
the public good, in view of the great advantages
to be thereby secured. By this time, moreover, I
had many friends in Parliament, and even some
acquaintance with one or two members of the
Government; which encouraged me to hope that my
plan would, at least, receive attention; and attention,
I was sanguine enough to think, must soon induce
adoption.</p>

<p>I set to work, therefore, to give my matter such
shape as seemed best fitted to illustrate my facts and
give force to my arguments. In urging the various
benefits to be anticipated from cheap and easy postal
conveyance, I did not fail to dwell on its aid to education,
which was then at length beginning to be regarded
as a matter of national interest and national duty,
though the movement in its favour was still grievously
clogged by sectarian prejudice and political animosities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
The following passage will show that I gave it the
chief place in my summary:—<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Its object is not to increase the political power of this or that
party, but to benefit all sects in politics and religion; and all classes
from the highest to the lowest. To the rich, as to the less wealthy,
it will be acceptable, from the increased facilities it will afford for
their correspondence. To the middle classes it will bring relief
from oppressive and irritating demands which they pay grudgingly;
estimating them even beyond their real amount, because probably
of their frequent recurrence—which they avoid by every possible
contrivance, and which they would consider quite intolerable if they
knew that nearly the whole is a tax. And to the poor it will afford
the means of communication with their distant friends and relatives,
from which they are at present debarred. It will give increased
energy to trade; it will remove innumerable temptations to fraud;
and it will be an important step in general education; the more
important, perhaps, because it calls on Government for no factitious
aid, for nothing in the shape of encouragement, still less of compulsion;
but merely for the removal of an obstacle, created by
the law, to that spontaneous education which happily is extending
through the country, and which, even the opponents of a national
system will agree, ought to be unobstructed in its progress.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">PROMULGATION OF MY PLAN.</span></h3>

<p>As yet I had proceeded almost alone; but when I
had made a draft of my intended pamphlet, our usual
family council was convened, to hear it read and
consider its contents. I cannot now recall, even
vaguely, the various discussions that ensued, nor the
suggestions and modifications to which they gave rise;
but the general result was a hearty approval of the
plan, and that ready co-operation in promoting it
which never failed me in any need, either before or
after. Probably the wording of the draft underwent
various changes, but the general tenour remained unaltered;
and when all had been done that our united
care could effect, the paper was printed (though
marked “Private and Confidential.”) With certain
exceptions, to be named hereafter, and with some
additions to the Appendix, it was substantially and
almost literally the same as that subsequently published
under the title of “Post Office Reform, Second
Edition.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>When, however, I placed my paper in the hands of
Government (which I did early in January, 1837), it
was in the earnest desire that no publication might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Hoping, with the sanguine expectation of
an inventor, that a right understanding of my plan
must secure its adoption, and relying with confidence
on the clearness and force of my exposition, I little
knew as yet the endless complexities in the machine of
Government, the deep-rooted prejudice of routine, or
the countless interests ready to start up in alarm at the
appearance of innovation.</p>

<p>The first result, however, of my sending in my
treatise was encouraging, as I received a summons to
wait upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.
Spring Rice. I must add that he received me courteously,
that he listened attentively to my representations,
and seemed to imply a sort of general
approval of my plan, by suggesting some modification
in detail, advising the reconsideration of some of its
parts, and recommending that in some others the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and arguments should be given more in detail; and, in
conclusion, by requesting me to send in a supplement
to my paper.</p>

<p>In this document, which I sent in on the 28th of
the same month (January), I gave more in detail my
reasons for expecting a great increase in the number of
letters. The ounce, which I had taken merely as the
lowest rate then recognised in the Post Office, having
been objected to as too large for the minimum weight
and measure of increase (on the ground that it would
allow several letters to be sent under one cover, to be
afterwards distributed by private hand), I adopted the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s suggestion for the
substitution of the half-ounce. Perhaps some future
reformer may recommend the restoration of the
original standard.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> On the other hand, the pound
having been objected to as too high a maximum, since
its use might excite discontent among coach proprietors
and other carriers, who would probably regard it as an
interference with their trade, I proposed a reduction
to four ounces. At a later period, however, if I may
so far anticipate events, when penny postage came to
be established, the pound limit was the one adopted,
and even this limitation was afterwards withdrawn,
so as to leave no restriction in weight save what
would arise from augmented charge.</p>

<p>I had also to deal with the question of prepayment,
on which difficulties had been raised both in the office
and by some persons without; the former taking
alarm lest its establishment, however attained, should
greatly diminish the amount of correspondence, and
the latter objecting that it would enable the clerks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the Post Office to become possessed of information
relative to parties corresponding which might be used
for the commercial injury of one or other, and also
pointing out that servants or others intrusted with
money for the payment of postage might be tempted
to keep this for their own use, destroying the letters to
conceal their dishonesty. While giving various reasons,
which I need not repeat, for declining to share
in the alarm of the Post Office, I suggested, as a
means of obviating the other difficulties, the use of
stamped covers, a device which, as I have already
mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> had been originally recommended, not,
indeed, for letters, but for newspapers, by Mr. Charles
Knight; and I take occasion to remark that the mention
of this expedient, as applied to letters, occurred
for the first time in this supplementary paper. I
pointed out at the same time that, to whatever extent
the covers might be used, to that extent, or nearly so,
the revenue would be collected in large sums instead of
small, a change obviously tending to the simplification
of accounts in the department concerned.</p>

<p>I submitted at the same time that mode of gradual
introduction of my plan which appeared almost immediately
afterwards in the second edition of my
pamphlet; and, as time would be required for the
preliminary arrangements necessarily extending over
the whole country, I suggested its experimental application,
in the meantime, to the local correspondence of
the London District, containing, as I pointed out, one-twelfth
part of the whole population of the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>To return to my interview with the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, I must admit that the hopes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which it began were considerably damped before its
close. I was at least made very distinctly aware that
Government had by no means made up its mind to
the adoption of my plan. This was very disappointing,
for I could not but feel that unless the plan were
voluntarily taken up by Government, its introduction
would have to encounter serious obstacles, and would
be attended with grave disadvantages. If the public
must be called on to enforce attention on a reluctant
Government, even supposing the call to be answered,
the plan would have to be adopted in such shape and
in such manner as the public voice might demand,
little thanks meantime being given for the concession;
whereas if Government kept the matter entirely in its
own hands, it might proceed tentatively, and therefore
safely; lowering the rates with caution, and meanwhile
removing anomalies, increasing facilities, extending
operations, and taking all other measures tending to
enlarge public convenience, to increase correspondence,
and to sustain the revenue; while every succeeding
improvement would come with a grace, and be
received with gratitude. To this hour I regret that
this course was not taken; believing that by it much
misunderstanding, nay, much animosity, would have
been prevented, much trouble saved, facilities more
promptly secured, and even the loss of revenue, which,
in the year following the adoption of my plan compelled
a temporary augmentation of other duties,
altogether avoided.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as I laid my plan before Government,
I took into council a few trusty friends, and
thus had the benefit of various criticisms, and of some
suggestions. Of all those I consulted there was no one
whose reply I awaited with greater anxiety than that
of Mr. Wallace, already recognised as the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Post Office reformer of the day. Would he not treat
me as an intruder on his domain, a poacher on his
manor? Would he not at best give me but a cold
approval, keeping his heart all the while for his own
device? His prompt reply brought full relief. It
was couched in kind and encouraging language, and
conveyed his hearty concurrence in the main features
of my plan. In recognising the generosity of his
conduct, I felt also that a great point was gained.
Nor did the sequel fail to confirm the first impression.
Mr. Wallace gave me all the advantage of his position,
and laboured through three anxious years to
promote my views as earnestly as if they had been
his own.</p>

<p>Within a few days from my sending in the supplementary
paper to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I
had occasion again to trouble him. Mr. Labouchere
having given notice of motion for a bill to amend the
Post Office Laws, it seemed important that my plan,
unless the Government itself were going to take it up,
should be forthwith presented to the public, with a
view to its producing some effect on the contemplated
legislation; and it became necessary to inquire whether
it would be proper to publish the paper. I thought,
moreover, that if the Government seriously entertained
my project, such intention would be given as a reason
for withholding leave of publication; and that thus I
should obtain some indication on the subject. I was
informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had no
objection whatever to its publication; and so I brought
out my little work with all speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had received many encouraging letters,
some from private friends, and others from persons
to whom I was less known, or not known at all.
Amongst those which gave me the most satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
was one from Colonel Colby, who, in expressing
approval of my paper, gave me also some account of
exertions previously made by himself with a view
to the gradual reduction of postage rates for long
distances. A second letter was from Mr. Raikes
Currie, who afterwards was a member of the Parliamentary
Committee appointed to consider my plan,
and a third from Professor Empson, of Haileybury
College, who reported that he had heard my plan
spoken of in Edinburgh, at a dinner at the Lord
Advocate’s, in the most favourable terms; and who
undertook to speak about it, within a few hours, to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, “if he can listen
to anything and anybody except banks and bankers.”
Now that penny postage has long been an established
fact, and that doubt of its practicability has
disappeared in the certainty of success, the circumstances
just mentioned may seem trivial; but in the
midst of the anxiety that attended its incipient course,
every indication of advancing favour was eagerly
received and carefully recorded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, a proceeding of yet greater
importance had taken place. Soon after the private
circulation of my pamphlet, I received a summons to
give evidence before the Commission for Post Office
Inquiry already mentioned, which was now collecting
matter for its ninth report, (the subject being the
London Twopenny Post, though the term comprehended
also the threepenny delivery). The Commissioners
were the late Lord Bessborough (then Lord
Duncannon), Lord Taunton (then Mr. Labouchere),
and the Duke of Somerset (then Lord Seymour).
I need not say that their invitation was gladly
accepted; my first examination took place on February
13th, 1837; and in my evidence I pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the principal defects, in the existing system of distribution
within the London district.</p>

<p>The first was that the deliveries were too few and
too slow; and the second, that all letters, whencesoever
collected or whithersoever going, had, with
some trifling exceptions, to be sent primarily to the
central office in St. Martin’s-le-Grand. It will
hardly be believed now that, by the combined effect
of these two mal-arrangements, the time required for
an interchange of letters within London itself was,
on the average, little less than fifteen hours; while
between London and Tottenham, the distance from
the central office being under seven miles, and the
road supplied with coaches passing to and fro at all
hours of the day, the average was as high as nearly
twenty-five hours.</p>

<p>In the way of remedies, I proposed, first, that the
rate, supposing the postage to be prepaid, should be
reduced from twopence or threepence to one penny;
secondly, that the deliveries should be made hourly;
the necessary facilities to be afforded by the establishment
of district offices, and the combining in one body
the two sets of letter carriers then employed,—the one
in delivering the local, or, as they were called, the
twopenny post letters, the others those arriving from
without the district, which were called general post
letters. These several improvements, I scarcely need
say, have now been effected, though after long delay,
to be hereafter explained.</p>

<p>Considering the comparatively small amount of
reduction to be made on the district letters, leaving
the postage, on the average, at nearly one-half of its
existing rate, I did not estimate the consequent increase
in number, even supposing all facilities to be
afforded, at more than three-fold. I may observe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
in passing, that it is now (1867) more than seven-fold.</p>

<p>For further facility I suggested that improvement
in the nomenclature of streets which is now in progress;
and I may here mention that as the suggestion
was fruitless at the time, I took occasion at a later
period, when the bill to establish the Board of Works
was in hand, to obtain the insertion of the clause
giving the requisite powers.</p>

<p>Having, previously to my examination, in a letter
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made the first
mention of stamps, I repeated the suggestion here.
I have already said whence the first notion was
derived, and how far it extended; but as there has
been some little public discussion on the matter, I
extract from my evidence the passage relating to it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A few years ago, when the expediency of entirely abolishing
the newspaper stamp, and allowing newspapers to pass through the
Post Office for one penny each, was under consideration, it was
suggested by Mr. Charles Knight, the publisher, that the postage on
newspapers might be collected by selling stamped wrappers at one
penny each.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Availing myself of this excellent suggestion, I propose
the following arrangement:</p>

<p>“Let stamped covers and sheets of paper be supplied to the public
from the Stamp Office or Post Office, as may be most convenient,
and sold at such a price as to include the postage. Letters and
newspapers so stamped might be put into the [Post Office] letter-box,
as at present, instead of being delivered to the receiver.</p>

<p>“Covers, at various prices, would be required for packets of
various weights; and each should have the weight it is entitled
to carry legibly printed with the stamp.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“Should experience warrant the Government in making the use of
stamped covers universal, most important advantages will be secured—advantages,
indeed, of such magnitude, that before any exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
whatever is admitted, the policy of such exception should be very
fully considered.</p>

<p>“1. The Post Office would be relieved altogether from the collection
of the revenue, and from all accounts relating to that collection.
Distribution would be its only function.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“The only objection which occurs to me to the universal adoption
of this plan is the following: Persons unaccustomed to write letters
would, perhaps, be at a loss how to proceed. They might send
or take their letters to the Post Office without having had recourse
to the stamp. It is true that, on presentation of the letter, the
receiver, instead of accepting the money as postage, might take it as
the price of a cover or band, in which the bringer might immediately
enclose the letter, and then redirect it; but the bringer would sometimes
be unable to write. Perhaps this difficulty might be obviated
by using a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and
covered at the back with a glutinous wash, which the bringer might,
by applying a little moisture, attach to the back of the letter, so as to
avoid the necessity for redirecting it.”<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is curious to observe, by the last paragraph of
the above, that the adhesive stamp, now of universal
and indeed almost exclusive use, was originally devised
as a mere expedient for exceptional cases; the
stamped cover, which it has displaced, being the
means of payment which was expected to become
general. Although I hoped at this time, that in order
to relieve the Post Office of all account-keeping, and
to prevent all avoidable delay in delivery, prepayment
would in the end be made universal, yet, knowing
how much better it is to induce than to compel, I
proposed that in the outset, at least, the alternative
should be allowed; the old rate of twopence or threepence
remaining undiminished where payment was
deferred.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>My first examination being finished, I was informed
that Mr. Robert Smith, then head of the Twopenny
Post Department, would be called on for his evidence,
and that afterwards I should have opportunity of commenting
thereon. Knowing that there would be much
difference between us, and fearing that reply and
rejoinder, if made in the ordinary way, might weary
out the Commissioners before they could arrive at any
sound conclusion, I ventured to suggest that we should
be examined together. I was not aware of any precedent
for this course, nor do I know that it has ever
been repeated. The plan, however, was adopted by
the Commissioners, and with good success. In this
manner, statement promptly met counter-statement,
and argument counter-argument; so much so, indeed,
that the proceeding, as will be seen on reference to the
evidence,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> eventually took the form rather of discussion
between Mr. Smith and me than of examination of
either; much to the saving of time, and the facilitation
of conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace also gave earnest evidence in support
of my views, and the result was that the Commissioners
recommended as immediate measures, by way of
experiment, the optional use of stamped penny covers
within the London District, increase in the weight
allowed in a single packet, and an additional daily
delivery; and on the presentation to the House of
Commons of an important petition, of which I shall
speak hereafter, Lord Duncannon announced that it
was the intention of Government to carry so much
of the plan into effect.</p>

<p>While I could not but regard this concession as
a great triumph, I had nevertheless to guard against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
a serious danger, the reality of which subsequent
events did not fail to demonstrate. Lord Duncannon’s
intimation that the contemplated change would be
considered as a trial of the general plan, made it
necessary to guard against inferences to be drawn from
a partial failure, which was but too probable; for
where the reduction in postage would be but small,
frequent and rapid delivery was my main dependence;
and this, in the proposed measure, was to receive
scarcely any attention. Now should this be regarded
as a trial of my plan, and should its results, in consequence
of its incompleteness, fall short of what I
held out as likely to follow its complete adoption, there
was little chance that either the Post Office, or the
Government, or the public, or even the Commissioners,
would draw the necessary distinction and attribute the
partial failure to its true cause. I therefore felt that
I must put the matter in its true light, and that before
the trial should begin. I consequently wrote to the
Secretary of the Commissioners a letter, in which,
while expressing my satisfaction at the intended
change, I very distinctly pointed out that it would
afford no test of my plan, as this could not be fairly
tried unless adopted in its integrity so as to comprehend
division into districts with hourly deliveries.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> This
last course, therefore, I again urged on the Commissioners;
pointing out that the amount of revenue
at stake in so limited a change was but small; that
success here would warrant extension of the plan,
while failure would set the matter at rest.</p>

<p>I had the satisfaction to learn that this letter produced
its intended effect. After reconsidering the
question, the Commissioners, guardedly, but yet
distinctly, spoke in favour of complete adoption within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the London District;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> a course, I may observe, which,
besides its immediate benefit, would have subjected my
plan to a tolerably fair experiment. It is curious to
remark that the point on which the Commissioners
spoke with most hesitation is one which never presented
any real difficulty, viz., the practicability of
general prepayment.</p>

<p>It now only remained to see whether the Government
would act on the recommendation of its own
Commission, which certainly seemed the more probable
as all the Commissioners were likewise members of
Government. This fair prospect, however, ended in
disappointment; nothing whatever was done. My
only consolation for the moment was that my plan had
escaped an unfair trial.</p>

<p>The rejection of this very moderate and limited
improvement made it clear that the only course left
was to bring the public voice to bear forcibly on the
question. I was, as already implied, very reluctant
to take any step to promote such a result; and I had
even, in the first edition of my pamphlet, held forth an
earnest warning on the subject. I give the passage.
Unfortunately for the Government, as well as for
myself, it proved prophetic to the letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Judging from the rapid growth of public opinion which we have
recently witnessed with regard to other institutions, we may expect
that in a few years, or even months, if ‘the still small voice’ which,
at present, gives scarcely audible expression to half-formed desires, be
neglected, it will swell into a loud, distinct, and irresistible demand;
and then a reform, which would now be received with gratitude,
as one of the greatest boons ever conferred on a people by its
Government, would perhaps be taken without thanks, and even
with expressions of disappointment, because less extensive than
unreasonable people might have expected.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>But could the public voice be drawn forth? Doubtless
the proposed reduction of postage would be
acceptable enough; but would the measure be regarded
as practicable, as capable of adoption without such
loss to the revenue as would necessitate the imposition
of yet heavier burdens? Could the public be got
to take the plan into its serious consideration? Was
not a proposal so paradoxical likely to be classed with
numberless wild schemes, which had enjoyed a momentary
attention only to be thrown aside with scorn?
Was not a conclusion, which had startled myself, even
when I had arrived at it by laborious investigation,
likely to be ridiculed as absurd by those to whom it
was presented in the abrupt manner in which it would
inevitably reach most minds? That a large portion
of the public would thus deal with it was beyond all
doubt; and would there be a yet larger or more
influential body to take the opposite course? Even
supposing this to be so, would the majority be sufficiently
large and influential to carry Parliament with
it, to constrain Government, and to overbear the Post
Office; which, so far as indications went, seemed likely
to put forth all its powers of obstruction?</p>

<p>These questions it was not easy to answer; but
repeated success in innovation had inspired confidence.
Bold as the attempt appeared, and doubtful as the issue
must be, it was advised by my father and brothers,
whom I as usual consulted, that trial should be made.
Knowing that I should derive from them whatever aid
it was in their power to afford, I proceeded to the
work, having, however, as yet no more time to employ
in it than remained after the full discharge of the
duties attaching to my post as Secretary to the South
Australian Commission.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, I had already published the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
pamphlet previously circulated as private and confidential,
and it is to this publication that I have
already made repeated reference, under the title, “Post
Office Reform, Second Edition.”</p>

<p>The appearance of the pamphlet speedily brought
in letters from various quarters, amongst others an
amusing one from Leigh Hunt, in which he declared
that the reasoning of my pamphlet “carries us all
along with it as smoothly as wheel on railroad,” and
another from a gentleman known to me in relation to
Australian affairs, who advised that my pamphlet
should be republished in as cheap a form as possible,
offering himself to bear half the expense; an offer
afterwards repeated by Mr. Cobden. Why these
offers were not accepted I cannot now recollect. The
same gentleman also informed me of a remarkable
instance of exorbitant postage which had come to his
knowledge. The captain of a ship arriving at Deal
had posted for London a packet weighing thirty-two
ounces, which came to the person to whom it was
addressed charged with a postage not of five shillings
and sixpence, according to the rate proposed by me,
but of upwards of six pounds, “being,” as my informant
observed, “four times as much as the charge
for an inside place by the mail.” So that, had the
captain, instead of posting the letter, sent a special
messenger with it up to London, allowing him to
travel inside both ways, and paying him handsomely
for his time, as well as indemnifying him for his travelling
expenses, the result would have been a considerable
saving.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The following yet stronger case was afterwards thus
mentioned in a letter from Sir John Burgoyne to my
friend Mr. Moffatt, who obligingly placed the letter
in my hands. The name of this gallant veteran I
cannot pass over without gratefully mentioning that
he was one of those who zealously co-operated in the
movement. Even at his present advanced age his
interest in postal success remains warm and active.</p>

carpet-bags, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following incident I found not less amusing
than encouraging:—</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Place, the author of “Principles of
Population,” but better known as a leading man on
the Liberal side at Westminster elections, having
received a copy of my pamphlet, remarked to an
inquiring friend that he had not thought it worth
perusal, having supposed that it was only some nonsensical
scheme for carrying letters all over England
for a penny, and being wearied out with wild-goose
proposals for all sorts of impracticable measures.
Having, however, promised to look at the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
some fine day, he at length, as he afterwards avowed,
began the perusal in the confident expectation that he
should soon find out “the hitch!” and although as he
went on he step by step admitted the soundness of the
reasoning, he was still sure that he should find “the
hitch” somewhere. In this quest he read on to the
end of the book, finishing with the exclamation,—I
quote his own words—“I’ll be damned if there is a
hitch!”</p>

<p>And here I may mention one member of my family,
now no more, who, though unknown save in his own
neighbourhood, where, however, he was highly
respected, used his industry and his local influence,
both great, from first to last, in aid of the cause,
viz., my brother-in-law, Mr. Francis Clark, one of
the magistrates of Birmingham, but afterwards resident
at Adelaide, South Australia.</p>

<p>Some of the journals now began to notice my
pamphlet, and within the year the support of the press
was almost universal. Amongst all, however, the most
earnest was the <i>Spectator</i>, then conducted by my
friend, the late Mr. Rintoul, which maintained throughout
his editorship, with unflagging earnestness, the
able advocacy then begun.</p>

<p>A little later, but still within two months from the
appearance of the pamphlet, Mr. Gibbon Wakefield
informed me that he and Mr. Rintoul had had a conference
with Daniel O’Connell, who not only promised
his powerful aid, but even volunteered to move for a
committee on the plan. I suppose, however, he must
have given way to Mr. Wallace, who, about a week
later, viz., on May 9th, made a motion for that purpose,
which, nevertheless, he withdrew at the request
of Lord John Russell and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
who informed the House that the plan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
under the consideration of Government. On May 30th
Lord Ashburton presented a petition to the House
of Lords in its favour—a petition remarkable for
the high character or position of those who signed
it. On the same evening an identical petition was
presented to the House of Commons by Mr. Grote.</p>

<p>All this was very satisfactory; but about a fortnight
later, viz., on June 15th, the plan and its supporters
had to endure strictures the reverse of complimentary.
The Earl of Lichfield, then Postmaster-General, in
moving the second reading of a bill relative to Post
Office affairs, asserted, in opposition to Lord Ashburton,
that the revenue of the department had considerably
increased, that it was produced by 170,000,000
of letters annually circulated in England, and that if
the reduction in duty for which some individuals called
were acceded to, it would require the enormous number
of 416,000,000 annually to produce the same
amount of revenue.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> “With respect to the plan set
forth by Mr. Hill,” he said, “of all the wild and
visionary schemes which he had ever heard or read
of, it was the most extraordinary.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Save the completion of the “Ninth Report of the
Commissioners for Post Office Enquiry,” already so
often referred to, and the passing of the Act moved
by Lord Lichfield, of the value of which I shall speak
presently, little of importance occurred during the next
two months. Meanwhile I procured an introduction to
his lordship, from his brother, the late General Anson,
then visiting at the house of my father-in-law, Mr.
Pearson; and, being admitted to an interview, obtained,
through his means, a certain amount of information
from the Post Office, which, though not all
that I sought, was yet of considerable use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>On October 19th the matter was brought before the
Court of Common Council of the City of London, by
the late Mr. Pritchard, then High Bailiff of Southwark,
who invited me to attend below the bar, that I
might be at hand for reference. While there, Mr.
Pritchard having mentioned on my authority, that the
conveyance of a mail from London to Edinburgh cost
no more than five pounds, a member of the Common
Council, perhaps confounding mail with mail-coach,
came to me, inquiring whether I had really made such
an assertion; and, upon my answering in the affirmative,
walked away, with every expression of scorn for
a statement so obviously absurd. I need not remind
the reader that the amount was afterwards proved by
Post Office returns to be less than four pounds. Fortunately
the court did not agree with the critic;
resolutions being passed in favour of the plan, and
a petition for its adoption ordered to be presented to
both Houses of Parliament. Towns’ meetings also
began to be held in other places, and similar petitions
ordered. These events, combined with others previously
mentioned, had given me a confidence which,
self-reliant as I was prone to be, my own unaided
convictions could not have supplied.</p>

<p>Meantime, although my plan was for a time set
aside, the various efforts made in relation to the
general subject were not altogether without effect;
for, in the course of this year, day mails were established
on one or two of the principal roads, though
with some troublesome restrictions; amongst them,
one which now seems incredible, viz., against their use
for the despatch of the morning newspapers. Some
further reductions were made in foreign postage,
though certainly with due caution, as will now be
readily acknowledged by any one who learns that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
by an announcement gravely made, the public were
informed that henceforth postage on letters to the
Mediterranean would be at the rate of “only ten
<i>shillings</i> per ounce.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The legislative change already referred to as introduced
by Lord Lichfield was an important improvement,
bringing all the Acts (one hundred and forty-one
in number) relative to the Post Office into a single
law, possessing the triple advantage of compactness,
brevity, and perfect intelligibility.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Another Act
authorised the Postmaster-General, with the consent
of the Lords of the Treasury, to make reductions in
postage, both partially and generally; a trust which
afterwards proved of no small convenience. Lastly,
Government had announced as probable that the
postage between towns not more than seven miles
apart would be reduced from fourpence to twopence;
a change soon afterwards effected.</p>

<p>All these improvements, while more or less beneficial
in themselves, had the collateral advantage of paving
the way for future changes; and certainly enough
remained to be done, as would appear in the most
striking manner, were the old state of things to be
restored but for a single day, and the public compelled
but for once to endure practices which were then
regarded as things of course. Many of these have
been already adverted to; perhaps one or two more
may with propriety be mentioned here.</p>

<p>As the day mails were so few, most of the letters
arriving in London by the morning mails on their way
to other towns had to lie all day at the General Post
Office; so that places corresponding through London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
even if very near to one another, were, in postal
distance, kept as far asunder as London and Durham;
and when a blank post-day intervened, the delay was
even more remarkable. Thus, a letter written at
Uxbridge after the close of the Post Office on Friday
night was not delivered at Gravesend, a distance of
less than forty miles, until Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>If two letters were put in the proper district
receiving-houses in London between five and six
o’clock in the evening, one addressed to Highgate, the
other to Wolverhampton (which lies one hundred and
twenty miles further on the same road), the Highgate
letter was delivered last.</p>

<p>The postage of a letter from Wolverhampton to
Brierley Hill, conveyed by a cross-post passing through
Dudley, was only one penny; whereas if the letter
stopped short at Dudley, thus saving some miles in
conveyance, the charge rose to fourpence.</p>

<p>The absurd rule of charging by the number of
enclosures, instead of by weight, often caused great
irritation, especially when any one of the enclosures
was very diminutive. Thus, in an instance reported
to me at the time, a certain letter from London to
Wolverhampton, which now would be conveyed for
one penny, came charged with a postage of two
shillings and sixpence, viz., tenpence for the letter,
tenpence for a returned bill of exchange enclosed
therein, and tenpence for a small scrap of paper
attached to this latter at the notary’s office.</p>

<p>On the poorer classes the inconveniences fell with
special weight, for as letters almost always arrived
unpaid, while the postage was often too heavy to be
met at the moment, letters were sometimes withheld
for days, or even weeks, until the means of discharge
could be raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The necessity for ascertaining the number of
enclosures compelled the examination of every doubtful
letter, by the light of a lamp or candle placed
behind it; and this inspection, leading to the discovery
of bank-notes, &amp;c., which otherwise might have
escaped remark, exposed the clerks to needless temptation,
led to many acts of dishonesty, and brought
much loss to correspondents.</p>

<p>In addition to the dishonesty thus directly injurious
to individuals, there were other frauds which materially
affected the revenue. Such was the complication of
accounts, that the deputy postmasters could not be
held to effectual responsibility as respects the amounts
due from them to the General Office; and as many
instances of deficit came at times to light, sometimes
following each other week after week in the same
office, there can be no doubt that the total annual loss
must have reached a serious amount.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>A third edition of my pamphlet being called for
within the year, I took advantage of this, both to
notify new facts, and to indicate any further development
of my own views.</p>

<p>The net revenue of the Post Office for the year
1836 (unknown at the time of my previous publication)
showed some increase, and was expected
moreover to be in turn surpassed by that for 1837.
This progress was encouraging; for as the recent
changes in the Post Office arrangements, though not
of a decided character, consisted chiefly in reduced
charges and increased facilities, the results were,
<i>pro tanto</i>, confirmatory of the soundness of the
principles which I had advocated. The augmentation
in net revenue, moreover, was the more striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
because, by the reduction of the stamp duty on newspapers,
these had so increased in number, that their
conveyance and distribution, all of course gratuitous,
now comprised several additional millions; and because,
at the same time, commercial depression had
reduced the revenue in every other department.</p>

<p>This last fact could not but be viewed by some as
a formidable obstacle to the plan; and though I did
not see it in that light, believing that a reduction of
postage would give a stimulus to commerce, which
would greatly benefit all the other sources of revenue,
I suggested that the difficulty could be met by such
gradual adoption of the plan as might suit the
caution or timidity of the controlling authorities.
My recommendations appear in the following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It cannot be doubted that a reduction in postage to a certain
extent would benefit the Post Office revenue, and an opinion to
this effect is very general in the Post Office itself. Let, then, a
general system of reductions be put into immediate operation, and
extended as rapidly as the state of the revenue will permit; and
concurrently with this, let the means here pointed out for simplifying
the mechanism of the Post Office be adopted as far as practicable,
in order that the consequent increase in the amount of business may
not require an increased establishment.”</p>

</div>

<p>To give effect to these recommendations, I proposed
that, as a first step, the postage between post
towns should be immediately reduced by one half;
that the charge should depend no longer on the number
of enclosures, but on weight; that stamps should serve
at first for a very limited range, say for fifteen miles;
so that the numerous mistakes expected to occur in
their use (of which there was much groundless
apprehension) might admit of speedy and easy
correction; and, though at that time very desirous
of seeing prepayment made universal, because of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
complete simplicity which it would introduce into the
Post Office accounts, I recommended that an option
should be given, by which prepayment should always
be lower by one penny than post-payment. Of course
in recommending these expedients I did not swerve
from my original design; my expressed desire being
that these first measures should be gradually extended,
as experience warranted, until the whole plan was in
operation.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Much anxiety had been expressed, which under
present circumstances seems ludicrous enough, as to the
means by which the increased number of letters, on
which I relied for sustaining the revenue, could be
conveyed from town to town. A five-fold increase, it was
maintained, would require a five-fold number of mail-coaches;
and I was charged with having omitted this
material fact in my calculations. Reply was easy,
because, first, the existing mail-coaches were by no
means fully laden, many of them indeed having very
little to carry; and secondly, the chargeable letters
formed but an inconsiderable part of the mail; the
bulk of which consisted partly of newspapers, and
partly of letters and packages sent under franks,
insomuch that, startling as this may seem, the chargeable
letters then divided among the four-and-twenty
mail-coaches which left London every night might,
without displacing a single passenger, and without
exceeding or even equalling the ordinary load, have
been all forwarded by a single coach. In short,
instead of being justly exposed to the charge of
omission, I had made in my calculations, through
excess of caution, more than due allowance for the
increased expense, and that by the large amount of
£100,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Fortunately I was able truly to add “that though
my plan, with its estimates, had then been before the
public for several months, and though both had been
submitted not only to the general inquirer, but to the
scrutinising examination of those who had most
opportunity for acquiring knowledge on the subject,
no statement had appeared which invalidated any one
of the calculations.” Caution in statement, I may
observe, had been strengthened in me by almost all
the various trainings through which I had passed.
As an instructor, a surveyor, a machinist, an inventor,
a responsible secretary to an important
enterprise, I had had constant need for its exercise;
the more so, perhaps, as I was keenly sensible to
the ridicule that follows error, especially in innovators.</p>

<p>To return to my immediate subject. By this time,
the result of a reduction of postage made six years
before in a large portion of the London district, by
the extension of the twopenny range, had been shown
to be favourable; a return on the subject having been
called for by the Commissioners of Post Office Enquiry.
It had been calculated by the Post Office authorities
that this reduction would reduce the gross revenue
to the extent of £20,000 per annum; whereas at the
end of six years the revenue, instead of being a loser,
was by £10,000 a gainer.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Considerable reductions,
also, had recently taken place in the postage of
foreign letters; reductions already followed by a
great increase in receipts. Neither had any instance
occurred, within my knowledge, in which
reduction of postage had, after a fair trial, been
attended with loss to the revenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23rd of November, Parliament having
meantime reassembled, Mr. Wallace renewed his motion
for a committee on my plan, and though but ten
months had elapsed since my first publication, such
was already the progress of public opinion that the
committee was not only granted, but, as would appear
from the silence of “Hansard,” without even a debate.
The nomination of its members, which took place four
days later, gave the following list:—Mr. Wallace, Mr.
Poulett Thomson, Viscount Lowther, Lord Seymour,
Mr. Warburton, Sir Thomas Fremantle, Mr. Raikes
Currie, Mr. Morgan John O’Connell, Mr. Thornely,
Mr. Chalmers, Mr. Pease, Mr. Mahony, Mr. Parker
(Sheffield), Mr. George William Wood, Mr. Villiers.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The reference or instruction to the committee was
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To inquire into the present rates and mode of charging postage,
with a view to such a reduction thereof as may be made without
injury to the revenue; and for this purpose to examine especially
into the mode recommended for charging and collecting postage in
a pamphlet published by Mr. Rowland Hill.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Three members of this committee, viz., Lord Seymour,
Mr. Parker, and Mr. Poulett Thomson (afterwards
Lord Sydenham)—were also members of
Government, and, as I soon found, sat as opponents
to the plan.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I need not say, however, that the
appointment of the committee, whatever adverse
elements it might contain, filled me with high expectations;
so well assured was I by this time of the
soundness of my views, and so confident that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
would derive abundant support from the examination
to be made, whatever might be the ultimate decision
of the committee.</p>

<p>Three days later the Duke of Richmond, who had
formerly filled the office of Postmaster-General, in
presenting a petition from Elgin, took occasion
to recommend at least a considerable reduction of
postage rates. Lord Lichfield, in reply, declared that
“were the plan [of penny postage] adopted, instead of
a million and a half of money being added to the
revenue, after the expenditure of the establishment
was provided for, he was quite certain that such a loss
would be sustained as would compel them to have
recourse to Parliament for money to maintain the
establishment.”</p>

<p>On the same day (December 15th, 1837), Mr.
Hawes having asked in the House of Commons
whether Government had decided to give effect to
the recommendation of the Commissioners with regard
to stamped covers, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
replied that it was intended to introduce them in the
twopenny post department. In thus first mentioning
the name of Mr. (afterwards Sir Benjamin) Hawes, I
feel bound to add that the interest which he showed
thus early in my plan became warmer and warmer
as time advanced, and never ceased till his death.
The same may be said of Lord Brougham, of Mr.
Hume, and yet more emphatically of Mr. Warburton.
The real purport of the announcement now made,
though it does not clearly appear so in the words
quoted, was that the stamped cover should be used
within the range of the twopenny and threepenny post,
but without any reduction of postage there, so that
it would be merely a mode of payment in advance
(such payment not being then customary), without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
motive to its use. Sir Robert Peel pertinently asked
whether the two plans of reducing the postage and
using stamped covers could not be combined; but
the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that “they
would try the latter experiment first on the twopenny
post. If it succeeded they would try it on an extended
scale; at the same time he was bound to say that
while he did not wish to speak disparagingly of an
attempt he was himself about to try, he must add he
was not very sanguine as to the result.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Three days later Lord Brougham, in presenting the
petition from the Lord Mayor and Common Council of
the City of London, after having given some account
of Palmer’s great improvement, and spoken of the opposition
which it encountered, of the gloomy predictions
made as to its inevitable consequences, and of the
grand results obtained by its adoption, proceeded to
comment on the intention of Government to deviate
so widely from the recommendation of the Commissioners
of Post Office Enquiry as to adopt a plan
“totally different in its nature, and which might fail
over and over again without the possibility of even a
Post Office speculator pretending that it was a failure
of Mr. Hill’s plan, because it was to be confined to the
twopenny post.” Lord Duncannon replied that, “after
mature consideration, it was found to be inexpedient to
try the experiment of Mr. Hill’s plan to the full extent
that had been proposed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
did not intend to carry the suggestions of the
Commissioners into effect in the way proposed, but he
determined on the issue of penny<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> stamp covers for
the short distances, and to reduce the fourpenny post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to twopence. He admitted that this could not be considered
as a trial of Mr. Hill’s plan, but he thought it
the safer course in the first instance.”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The Postmaster-General, after having stated the
annual number of chargeable letters passing through
the Post Office (previously given by himself as
170,000,000) to be only 42,000,000, charged me with
having entirely omitted to provide for the greater bulk
of additional letters required by my plan, and alleged
that “if the postage charge were generally reduced to
a penny per letter, it would require twelve times the
present circulation of letters to produce the revenue
now derived from the Post Office charges.”<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> He
added, “The mails will have to carry twelve times as
much in weight, and therefore the charge for transmission,
instead of £100,000 as now, must be twelve
times that amount.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The day after this announcement—alarmed at the
notion of an experiment whose inevitable failure was
sure, in spite of Lord Duncannon’s disclaimer, to be
viewed as, so far, a failure of my plan—I wrote to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, asking whether,
before the change was made, I might be afforded an
opportunity of stating my views on the subject; at the
same time I expressed a hope that as I had in the first
instance submitted my plan to Government, had taken
pains to secure accuracy in all my statements, and had,
while attacking a system, carefully avoided all personalities,
I might be considered as entitled to some
attention, and even indulgence. The Chancellor
politely replied that he should have much pleasure
in seeing me, but was unable at present to fix a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for doing so; I cannot find, however, either in my
memory or in my memoranda, that this day ever
came.</p>

<p>So closed the year 1837, one of the busiest and most
important in my life; comprising my first application
to Government, the publication and republication and
second republication of my pamphlet, my examination
before the Commissioners of Post Office Enquiry, my
hope founded on their recommendation, its disappointment,
my appeal to the public, the appointment of a
parliamentary committee, and the earnest and various
support which had been accorded.</p>

<p>Considering that less than eighteen months had
elapsed from my first earnest attention to the subject,
and that I had not only worked with all the difficulties
and disadvantages of an <i>outsider</i>, but with the duties
of my post as South Australian Secretary pressing
heavily upon me, I had every reason to be satisfied
with my progress, though I will not undertake to say
that I thought so at the time. However, I had full
encouragement to proceed, the more so as I could not
then foresee that two more years of incessant toil would
precede the adoption of my plan—a toil which would
have been beyond my strength but for the constant
assistance received from the various members of my
family.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.</span></h3>

<p>I opened the year 1838 with a series of letters to
Lord Lichfield, which were inserted in all the morning
papers. These letters were written in the manner
described below; and it may save trouble hereafter to
remark that much else which has appeared under my
name, together with not a little to be found in my
minutes at the Treasury and at the Post Office, was
produced in the same way. To me the device and
elaboration of plans was incomparably easier than
their exposition or advocacy; with my brother Arthur
the case was the reverse; and this led me to the
frequent employment of his pen. What neither of
us could have effected separately, joint action made
easy.</p>

<p>Our mode of proceeding was as follows: I having
collected and arranged my facts and formed a skeleton
of the proposed paper, we sat down together, my
brother dictating and I writing, often, however, pausing
to bring the language into more exact expression
of my thoughts, or to mention, or at times to learn,
some new idea that arose as we went on. Occasionally,
however, when business pressed we worked
apart; but in any case the whole paper so constructed
underwent our joint revision, and we sometimes found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that the thoughts with which we had started had, in the
very attempt to express them, undergone such modification
that we rejected all that had been done, and
began our task afresh.</p>

<p>The letters to Lord Lichfield were written mainly
in reply to his lordship’s speeches in Parliament, from
which some passages have already been cited. From
these letters I give one or two quotations:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the series of letters which I shall take the liberty of addressing
to your lordship, I hope I shall carefully maintain that respect
for the claims, and consideration for the feelings of others, which, I
trust, have marked all that I have hitherto written. Your lordship
must be well aware that whoever enters on the task of innovation
must expect some amount of ridicule or abuse aimed either at his
plan or himself. Your lordship must feel that a person so circumstanced
ought not to allow such a necessary consequence of his
attempt either to deter him from his adopted course, or to provoke
his retaliation.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following passage from the third letter is in
reply to the announcement by Government that the
<i>principle</i> of stamped covers would be tried in the
London District:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Should the trial of stamped covers on the plan now unfortunately
contemplated issue in success, the world will indeed see a
paradox,—an effect without a cause. Were such an experiment
merely useless it might pass without comment; but its inevitable
failure may produce no small mischief. An apparent trial of a plan
may easily be confounded with a real one; and though I am sure
nothing could be further from the intentions of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, yet, had the aim been to throw unfair discredit on
the plan, it would have been difficult to devise a better mode of
proceeding.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following passage is from the last letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one remaining objection, which, as it can scarcely have
been made seriously, needs but little remark. Your lordship objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that, on the required increase in the amount of correspondence,
‘the whole area on which the Post Office stands would not be large
enough to receive the clerks and the letters.’ Without adverting to
the means which I have distinctly pointed out for obviating any such
inconvenience, I am sure that your lordship will not have much
hesitation in deciding whether, in this great and commercial country,
the size of the Post Office is to be regulated by the amount of correspondence,
or the amount of correspondence by the size of the Post
Office.”</p>

</div>

<p>About the time that the last of these letters appeared,
an important movement, which had been
already some weeks in preparation, took definite
shape. Mr. Moffatt, afterwards M.P. for Southampton,
had proposed to me the establishment of a
“Mercantile Committee,” to collect evidence in favour
of the plan. His proposal being gladly accepted, he
went to work with such earnestness, that I soon found
in him one of my most zealous, steady, and efficient
supporters. Funds he raised with comparative ease,
but the formation of a committee he found more difficult
than he had expected. Now, however, February
5th, 1838, he wrote to inform me that he had at
length prevailed upon Mr. Bates, of the House of
Baring Brothers, to accept the office of chairman; and
this point being secured, other good members were
easily obtained. As soon as the committee was
formed, I was invited to attend, in order to give such
information as might seem desirable, and to answer
such questions as any of the members might wish to
propose.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashurst, father of the [late] solicitor to the Post
Office, having been requested to act as solicitor to the
committee, went promptly to work; and though by
choice he acted gratuitously, he laboured with as much
ardour as if important personal interests were involved
in the issue. No less earnestness was shown by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Henry Cole,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> who had been engaged to aid in the
work. He was the author of almost innumerable
devices, by which, in his indefatigable ingenuity, he
contrived to draw public attention to the proposed
measure. He once passed through the Post Office,
and afterwards exhibited in fac-simile to the public eye
(the originals being previously shown in Parliament),
two letters, so arranged as to display, in the clearest
light, the absurdity of the existing rule of charge. Of
these, one nearly as light as a feather, and almost small
enough to require a pair of forceps for its handling,
quite a letter for Lilliput, but containing an enclosure,
bore double postage; while the other, weighing nearly
an ounce, eight inches broad, and more than a foot
long, when folded a very creditable letter for Brobdingnag,
but all written on one sheet, had its postage
single.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Parliamentary Committee, appointed
on the motion of Mr. Wallace, began its sittings.
Mr. Wallace, being appointed chairman, thenceforth
concentrated his indefatigable efforts upon its work;
and his labour during the whole session—his duties
being by no means confined to the formal sittings—was
most severe.</p>

<p>The committee sat no less than sixty-three days.
They examined “the Postmaster-General, the secretaries
and the solicitors of the three Post Offices of
England, Ireland, and Scotland, and other officers of
the Post Office department; obtained many important
returns from the Post Office, most of which they
directed to be prepared expressly for their use; and
also examined the chairman, secretary, and solicitor of
the Board of Stamps and Taxes, Mr. Rowland Hill,
and eighty-three other witnesses, of various occupations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
professions, and trades, from various parts of
the kingdom; in the selection of which they were
much assisted by an association of bankers and merchants
in London, formed expressly to aid the committee
in the prosecution of their inquiry.”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This
association was the committee formed by Mr. Moffatt.</p>

<p>The committee wisely directed its attention chiefly
to the question of inland postage, which indeed offered
abundant matter for investigation.</p>

<p>In speaking of the evidence given before this committee,
I follow not the order in which it was given,
but the classification observed in the final Report;
selecting, as the Report does, only those portions
which bear most strongly on the questions to be
resolved. My own evidence I shall in the main pass
over, seeing that it was in substance almost identical
with my pamphlet. My plan of “secondary distribution,”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
however, I now thought it expedient to
abandon, so far as regarded the existing range of post
office operations, not from any doubt of its justice or
intrinsic advantage, but with a view to simplify the
great question before the committee.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>One question, of course, related to the varying
rates of postage, which any one accustomed to present
simplicity would find sufficiently perplexing. In Great
Britain (for in Ireland it was somewhat different) the
postage on a single letter delivered within eight miles
of the office where it was posted was, as a general
rule—consequent on a recent reduction—twopence, the
lowest rate beyond that limit being fourpence. Beyond
fifteen miles it became fivepence; after which it rose a
penny at a time, but by irregular augmentation, to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
shilling, the charge for three hundred miles; one penny
more served for four hundred miles, and thenceforward
augmentation went on at the same rate, each
additional penny serving for another hundred miles.
This plan of charge, with various complications arising
out of it, produced remarkable anomalies.</p>

<p>As if this complexity were not quite enough, there
was as a general rule an additional charge of a half-penny
on a letter crossing the Scotch border; while
letters to or from Ireland had to bear, in addition,
packet rates, and rates for crossing the bridges over
the Conway and the Menai; or, if they took the
southern route, a rate chargeable at Milford.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Lastly,
there was the rule already mentioned, by which a
letter with the slightest enclosure incurred double
postage, and with two enclosures triple; the postage,
however, being regulated by weight whenever this
reached an ounce, at which point the charge became
quadruple; rising afterwards by a single postage for
every additional quarter of an ounce.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Surely it is
no wonder that Post Office officials, viewing prepayment
in connection with such whimsical complexity,
and probably thinking the connection indissoluble,
should be hopeless of inducing the public to adopt the
practice.</p>

<p>A second inquiry, which occupied much attention,
referred to the number of chargeable letters then
passing annually through the Office. The importance
of this question, which no longer appears at first
sight, was then so great that it was regarded as one
of the main points at issue between the Post Office
and myself.</p>

<p>Its importance arose thus. To estimate the increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in correspondence required for my purpose, it was
obviously necessary to know the amount of loss per
letter involved in the proposed reduction of postage;
in other words, the difference between the proposed
rate and the average of the rates actually paid, which
average had therefore to be arrived at. This I placed
at sixpence farthing, the Post Office authorities at a
shilling. Actual knowledge, however, did not exist,
and each party had resorted to calculation, dividing
the gross revenue by the supposed number of letters.
That number I then estimated at eighty-eight millions,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
the Post Office authoritatively declared it to be only
forty-two or forty-three millions;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> hence the difference
in our results as to the actual average of postage, and
consequently as to the required increase in correspondence,
which I fixed at five-and-a-quarter-fold, the
Post Office at twelve-fold.</p>

<p>Of course it would have been easy for the Post
Office authorities to correct their calculation, before
the appointment of the committee, by an actual counting
of letters; nor have I ever learned why this
corrective was not applied. I had indeed to thank
the department for obligingly supplying me with a fact
essential to my calculation, viz., the number of letters,
general and local, delivered in London in one week;
and had this fact been dealt with by the Post Office
as I myself dealt with it (a process, however, pronounced
incorrect by the office),<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> the same result, or
nearly so, must have been arrived at by both parties;
but, as already intimated, had the counting process
been applied to the whole country, as was afterwards
done on the requisition of the committee, the whole
question would have been settled at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Before my examination, however, I had been enabled,
by the civility of the Postmaster-General, to
obtain further information, chiefly as to the number
of letters delivered and postage collected in Birmingham;
and this had led me so far to modify my
former estimate, as to reduce it to seventy-nine and
a-half, or, in round numbers, to eighty millions.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> I
may here add that yet further information, supplied
on the requisition of the committee, enabling me to
make yet further correction, I again reduced my
estimate to seventy-eight millions.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> By the same
time, the Post Office, having abandoned the statement
so confidently put forth, had raised the number to
fifty-eight and a-quarter millions,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and this, after the
counting mentioned above, it again advanced to seventy
and a-quarter millions.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The committee, after very
elaborate calculations made by Mr. Warburton, fixed
it at seventy-seven and a-half millions,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> that is, ten
and a-half millions below my first rough estimate,
made on very limited information, and thirty-five and
a-half millions above the authoritative statement of
the Postmaster-General, made with all means of correction
at command. The committee’s conclusion as
to the number of letters confirmed also my estimate
as to the average single postage, viz., sixpence
farthing.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> It seems invidious, but I think it not
superfluous, thus distinctly to report the result, since
it may serve usefully to show, when other reforms
are called for, in this or any other department, that
official authority ought not imperiously to bear down
conclusions arrived at by earnest, laborious, and careful
investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>On the question as to the propriety of the existing
rates, Colonel Maberly, the Secretary, and other witnesses
from the Post Office, nearly all gave it as their
opinion that these rates were too high, at once for
the general interests of the public and also for those
of the revenue. Indeed, Colonel Maberly believed
that “every Postmaster-General had [so] thought them
for many years.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> He did not, however, explain why
this opinion, so generally entertained, had been so
barren in result; and, indeed, when the Postmaster-General
and the Secretary were interrogated by the
committee as to any general or even specific abatements
they might wish to recommend, no satisfactory
reply could be obtained.</p>

<p>The committee received much evidence, both as to
the extent to which the law was evaded by the
irregular conveyance of letters, and as to the evils
produced by suppression of correspondence where
circumstances rendered such evasion difficult or impracticable.
Thus Mr. Parker and other publishers
reported that it was a common practice, in their
trade, to write a number of letters for different individuals
in the same district, all on one sheet; and
that this, on first coming to hand, was cut up into its
several parts, each being delivered either by hand or
through the local posts.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Mr. Dillon, of the firm of
Morrison, Dillon, and Co., reported a similar practice,
in respect of money payments.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> By other witnesses it
was established that illicit correspondence was “carried
on throughout the country, in systematic evasion of
the law, if not in open violation of it, to an extent that
could hardly have been imagined, and which it would
be difficult to calculate;” this occurring “principally in
the neighbourhood of large towns, and in populous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
manufacturing districts;” some carriers making it
“their sole business to collect and distribute letters,”
which they did “openly, without fear of the consequences;
women and children” being “employed to
collect the letters.”<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Throughout one district the
practice was “said to be universal, and was known
to have been established there for nearly fifty years.”<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
“The average number of letters thus sent daily
throughout the year by a house in the neighbourhood
of Walsall exceeded fifty, and by that house more
than a hundred and twenty had been sent in one day.
Not one-fiftieth part of the letters from Walsall to the
neighbouring towns was sent by post.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cobden, as yet new to fame, but who had been
deputed by the Chamber of Commerce at Manchester
to give in evidence the results of its inquiries,
reported thus—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The extent to which evasion is there practised is incredible;
five-sixths of the letters from Manchester to London do not pass
through the Post Office.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Similar evidence was received from Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Mr.
Brewin, of Cirencester, reported that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The people in that town did not think of using the post for the
conveyance of letters; he knew two carriers who carried four times
as many letters as the mail did.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Further evidence, equally weighty and equally
striking, came in from other quarters.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Various
devices, now doubtless forgotten through disuse, were
then in constant requisition; thus letters for travellers
and others in the trade were habitually enclosed in
the parcels sent by the great London booksellers to
their customers in the provinces; similar use was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
made of warehousemen’s bales and parcels, and of
boxes and trunks forwarded by carriers; as also of
what were termed “free packets,” containing the
patterns and correspondence of manufacturers, which
the coach proprietors carried free of charge, except
fourpence for booking. In the neighbourhood of
Glasgow recourse was had to “weavers’ bags,” that
is, bags containing work for the weavers, which the
manufacturers forwarded to some neighbouring town,
and of “family boxes”—farmers having sons at the
University forwarding to them once or twice a week
boxes containing provisions, and the neighbours making
a Post Office of the farmer’s house.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Maberly, however, did not attach much value
to all this evidence, knowing “from long experience,
when he was in Parliament, that merchants and interested
parties are very apt to overstate their case,”
and his view was supported by some of his subordinates,
though strongly contradicted by others, especially by the
late solicitor to the General Post Office, Mr. Peacock,
who “apprehends the illegal conveyance of letters to
be carried to a very great extent at the present moment,
and has no doubt that persons of respectability
in the higher, as well as the humbler walks of life, are
in the habit of sending letters by illegal conveyance
to a great extent.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The same general opinion was
strongly expressed by the solicitor to the Irish Post
Office who represented even the drivers and guards
of the mail-coaches as constantly engaged in the illegal
traffic.</p>

<p>In relation to letters going abroad, the following is
the summary of the evidence:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The evasion of the postage on letters sent from different parts of
the United Kingdom to the out-ports, for the purpose of being put
on board of ships bound to foreign parts, especially to the United
States of America, is yet more remarkable than the evasion of the
inland postage. It is thoroughly known to the Post Office authorities;
but the practice appears to be winked at. Colonel Maberly
speaks of that practice as one known, and almost recognised.”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The following curious fact was stated by a witness
from Liverpool, Mr. Maury, president of the “American
Chamber of Commerce.” When arrangements had
been completed for the establishment of regular steam
navigation between that town and New York, the
postmaster, expecting to have a large despatch of
letters to provide for, was careful to furnish himself
with a bag of ample dimensions, but, “to his astonishment,
received only five letters in all,” though “by the
first steamer at least ten thousand letters were in fact
sent, all in one bag, which was opened at the office of
the consignee of the ship. Mr. Maury himself sent
at least two hundred letters by that ship, which went
free.”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>These extraordinary statements were strongly supported
by the evidence of Mr. Lawrence, Assistant
Secretary to the London Office, who “states that,
from what the Post Office have learnt, the American
packet, which leaves London every ten days, carries
4,000 letters, each voyage, which do not pass through
the Post Office; that he is aware of the existence in
London of receiving-houses for letters, to be forwarded
otherwise than by the Post; the Jerusalem Coffee-house,
for instance, receives letters for the East Indies;
the North and South American Coffee-house, for South
America, the United States, and British America; that
almost every ship-broker in London has a bag hanging
up for letters to be forwarded by the ship to which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
is broker; and that the number of letters for North
America so collected for several ships in the office of
one ship-broker have been enough to load a cab.”</p>

<p>In short, the committee came “to the conclusion
that, with regard to large classes of the community,
those principally to whom it is a matter of necessity to
correspond on matters of business, and to whom, also,
it is a matter of importance to save the expense of
postage, the Post Office, instead of being viewed as it
ought to be, and would be, under a wise administration
of it, as an institution of ready and universal access,
distributing equally to all, and with an open hand, the
blessing of commerce and civilization, is regarded by
them as an establishment too expensive to be made
use of, and as one with the employment of which
they endeavour to dispense by every means in their
power.”<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>They also became convinced that if it were possible,
by increased rigour, to put a stop to the illicit transmission
of letters, a vast diminution must take place in
the number of letters written; and that the suppression
of correspondence already caused by high rates would
be greatly magnified. One witness had “made a calculation
some time ago among the poor manufacturers,
and found that, when one of them in full work could
earn forty shillings a week, he would receive, on an
average, thirty orders, which, at fourpence a piece, if
they went through the Post Office, would be twenty-five
per cent. on his earnings.”<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>While, however, illicit correspondence was found
thus prevalent, there was abundant and striking evidence
to show that “high rates of postage deter the
public to a vast extent from writing letters and sending
communications which otherwise they would write or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
send;” that “even those who have the means of
evasion within their reach reduce their correspondence
greatly below the standard which, under other circumstances,
they would think expedient;” that “suppression
of correspondence on matters of business takes the
place of evasion in proportion as the transactions to be
announced or performed are moderate in amount, and
the condition in life of the parties is humble.”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Were it not too tedious to enumerate even the heads
under which suppression was deposed to, the reader,
accustomed to the present state of things, would be
astonished at the extent and variety to which movements
would be restricted by a return to the old rates.
Some few instances are all that can be noted. Who
would now divine that high rates of postage could
have any relation to the prevalence of small-pox?
And yet it was found that “Practitioners and others in
the country do not apply for lymph, in the degree
they otherwise would do, to the institutions formed
in London for the spread of vaccination, for fear of
postage.”</p>

<p>Again: “Sixpence,” says Mr. Brewin, “is a third
of a poor man’s daily income; if a gentleman, whose
fortune is a thousand pounds a year, or three pounds a
day, had to pay one-third of his daily income, that is,
a sovereign, for a letter, how often would he write
letters of friendship?” ... “The people do not
think of using the Post Office; it is barred against
them by the very high charge.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “Mr. G. Henson, a
working hosier from Nottingham, had given his wife
instructions not to take letters in unless they came
from particular persons; it would take half his income
were he to pay postage.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The following statement, showing at once the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and the inability of the poor to correspond, is taken
from the evidence of Mr. Emery, Deputy-Lieutenant
for Somersetshire, and a Commissioner of Taxes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A person in my parish of the name of Rosser had a letter from
a grand-daughter in London, and she could not take up the letter for
want of the means. She was a pauper, receiving two-and-sixpence a
week.... She told the Post Office keeper that she must wait
until she had received the money from the relieving officer; she
could never spare enough; and at last a lady gave her a shilling to
get the letter, but the letter had been returned to London by the
Post Office mistress. She never had the letter since. It came from
her grand-daughter, who is in service in London.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Struck by this statement, Mr. Emery made further
inquiries. The following statement he received from
the postmaster of Banwell:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My father kept the Post Office many years; he is lately dead;
he used to trust poor people very often with letters; they generally
could not pay the whole charge. He told me, indeed I know, he
did lose many pounds by letting poor people have their letters. We
sometimes return them to London in consequence of the inability of
the persons to whom they are addressed raising the postage. We
frequently keep them for weeks; and, where we know the parties, let
them have them, taking the chance of getting our money. One poor
woman once offered my sister a silver spoon, to keep until she could
raise the money; my sister did not take the spoon, and the woman
came with the amount in a day or two and took up the letter. It
came from her husband, who was confined for debt in prison; she
had six children, and was very badly off.”<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The following was reported by the postmaster of
Congresbury:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The price of a letter is a great tax on poor people. I sent one,
charged eightpence, to a poor labouring man about a week ago; it
came from his daughter. He first refused taking it, saying it would
take a loaf of bread from his other children; but, after hesitating a
little time, he paid the money, and opened the letter. I seldom return
letters of this kind to Bristol, because I let the poor people have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
them, and take the chance of being paid; sometimes I lose the
postage, but generally the poor people pay me by degrees.”<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The postmaster of Yatton stated as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have had a letter waiting lately from the husband of a poor
woman, who is at work in Wales; the charge was ninepence; it lay
many days, in consequence of her not being able to pay the postage.
I at last trusted her with it.”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Cobden stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have fifty thousand in Manchester who are Irish, or the
immediate descendants of Irish; and all the large towns in the
neighbourhood contain a great many Irish, or the descendants of
Irish, who are almost as much precluded, as though they lived in
New South Wales, from all correspondence or communication with
their relatives in Ireland.”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As the postage between Manchester and most parts
of Ireland was then about double the present postage
(1869) from any part of England or Ireland to Australia,
the separation between the Irish in Lancashire
and their countrymen at home must then have been,
postally considered, not only as great, but about twice
as great as is now that between the Irish at home and
their friends at the Antipodes.</p>

<p>Of the desire of the poor to correspond, Mr. Emery
gave further evidence, stating:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the poor near Bristol have signed a petition to Parliament
for the reduction of the postage. He never saw greater enthusiasm
in any public thing that was ever got up in the shape of a petition;
they seemed all to enter into the thing as fully, and with as much
feeling as it was possible, as a boon or godsend to them, that they
should be able to correspond with, their distant friends.”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Much evidence was also given as to the extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
moral evil caused by the suppression of correspondence.
On this point Mr. Henson speaks again:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When a man goes on the tramp, he must either take his family
with him, perhaps one child in arms, or else the wife must be left
behind; and the misery I have known them to be in, from not
knowing what has become of the husband, because they could not
hear from him, has been extreme. Perhaps the man, receiving only
sixpence, has never had the means, upon the whole line, of paying
tenpence for a letter to let his wife know where he was.”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Dunlop believed that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of the worst parts of the present system of heavy postage
is, that it gradually estranges an absentee from his home and family,
and tends to engender a neglect of the ties of blood, in fact, to
encourage a selfish spirit; at the same time he has known very
affecting instances of families in extreme poverty making a sacrifice
to obtain a letter from the Post Office.”<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Brankston said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have seen much of the evils resulting from the want of communication
between parents and their children among the young
persons in our establishment; I find the want of communication
with their parents by letter has led, in some instances, to vice and
profligacy which might have been otherwise prevented.”<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was also shown that one effect of suppression of
correspondence was to keep working-men ignorant
of the state of wages in different parts of the country,
so that they did not know where labour was in demand.
Thus Mr. Brewin said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We often see poor men travelling the country for work, and
sometimes they come back, and it appears they have been in a wrong
direction; if the postage were low they would write first, and know
whether they were likely to succeed.”<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Henson stated as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Shoemakers’ Society at Nottingham tell me that 350 persons
have come there for relief.... Very few of those persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
would have gone upon tramp if they could have sent circular letters
to a number of the largest towns in England at a penny to receive
information whether a job could be got or not.”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It may be observed that one of the main facts now
urged in favour of Trades Unions is, that they collect
and circulate the very information here spoken of as so
much wanting.</p>

<p>There was evidence to show that the difficulty of
communication aggravated—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The remarkable pertinacity of the poor to continue in their
own parish, rather than remove to another where their condition
would be bettered.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was also stated that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The consequence of the high rates, in preventing the working-classes
from having intercourse by letter, is, that those who learned
at school to write a copy have lost their ability to do so.”<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Henson adds that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are many persons, who, when he first knew them wrote an
excellent hand, but now, from their scarcely ever practising, they
write very badly: one of these persons is so much out of the habit
of writing that he would as soon do a day’s work, he says, as write a
letter: they are so much out of the habit of writing that they lose the
art altogether.”<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Davidson, of Glasgow, thought—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That additional opportunities of correspondence would lead the
industrious classes, the working-classes, to pay more attention to the
education of their children than they do now, and that it would have
a highly beneficial effect, both upon their moral and intellectual
character.”<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So strong was the sense entertained by some of the
witnesses of the evils inflicted on society by imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
a tax upon postage that they expressed their doubts
whether it were a fit subject for taxation at all. Mr.
Samuel Jones Loyd (now Lord Overstone), said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think if there be any one subject which ought not to have been
selected as a subject of taxation it is that of intercommunication by
post; and I would even go a step further, and say, that if there be
any one thing which the Government ought, consistently with its
great duties to the public, to do gratuitously, it is the carriage of
letters. We build national galleries, and furnish them with pictures;
we propose to create public walks, for the air and health and exercise
of the community, at the general cost of the country. I do not
think that either of those, useful and valuable as they are to the
community, and fit as they are for Government to sanction, are more
conducive to the moral and social advancement of the community
than the facility of intercourse by post. I therefore greatly regret
that the post was ever taken as a field for taxation, and should be
very glad to find that, consistently with the general interests of
the revenue, which the Government has to watch over, they can
effect any reduction in the total amount so received, or any reduction
in the charges, without diminishing the total amount.”<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Brown, and also Lord
Ashburton, strongly supported this opinion, the latter
saying:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The communication of letters by persons living at a distance is
the same as a communication by word of mouth between persons
living in the same town. You might as well tax words spoken
upon the Royal Exchange, as the communications of various
persons living in Manchester, Liverpool, and London. You
cannot do it without checking very essentially the disposition to
communicate.”<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I pause here in my narrative to bar an inference that
might very naturally be drawn from my citing the
above passages, viz., that in my opinion even the
present rates constitute a tax, and may therefore be
wisely and justly abandoned in favour of lower ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
or indeed of absolutely free conveyance. Certainly,
if it could be shown that some other corporation could
and would manage the whole correspondence, with all
its numerous and extensive rootlets and ramifications,
on lower terms than the Government, and this without
any sacrifice in speed or certainty, then the difference
between such lower rates and the present might fairly
be termed a tax; but I am not aware that such
capability has yet been conceived, still less seriously
maintained; and indeed I cannot but believe that,
taking the duty as a whole, the Post Office, so long
as it is well managed, is likely to do the work on better
terms than any rival institution.</p>

<p>Another opinion erroneously attributed to me, and
connected with the above, is, that so long as the
department thrives as a whole, its funds may justly
be applied to maintain special services which do not
repay their own cost; whereas, from the first, I have
held that every division of the service should be at
least self-supporting,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> though I allowed that, for the
sake of simplicity, extensions might be made where
there was no immediate expectation of absolute
profit.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> All beyond this I have always regarded as
contrary to the true principles of free trade, as
swerving into the unsound and dangerous practice of
protection. Whenever, therefore, it is thought that
the net revenue from the Post Office is too high
for the interests of the public, I would advise the
application of the surplus to the multiplication of
facilities in those districts in which, through the
extent of their correspondence, such revenue is
produced.</p>

<p>To return to the evidence. With regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
amount of reduction that it would be expedient to
make, the witnesses generally, whether from the Post
Office or otherwise, were of opinion that it must be
large; illicit conveyance having become too firmly
established to be effectually dealt with by any moderate
change. The Secretary indeed was of opinion—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That to whatever extent the postage is reduced, those who have
hitherto evaded it will continue to evade it, since it cannot be
reduced to that price that smugglers will not compete with the
Post Office, at an immense profit.”<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It has already been shown that a very important,
indeed essential, part of my plan was uniformity of
rate. To this various objections were raised, some of
which would now seem frivolous enough. As an
instance, I may mention the statement—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That in certain cases extra rates are levied, and are applicable to
the maintenance of certain roads and bridges, undertaken with a
view to expedite the mails which travel over them.”<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An objection the more frivolous as the total amount of
the rates thus levied was less than £8,000.</p>

<p>Some witnesses from the Post Office regarded the
uniform rate as “unfair in principle.”<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Dr. Lardner,
while he regarded it as abstractedly unjust, yet thought
it should be recommended on account of its simplicity.
All the other witnesses were in its favour, provided
the rate were as low as one penny; and nearly all
considered a uniform rate preferable to a varying one,
though the rate should somewhat exceed one penny.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Jones Loyd observed that the—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Justice of the uniform plan is perfectly obvious. You are not
warranted in varying the charge to different individuals, except upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the ground that the cost of conveyance varies; so far as that varies the
charge ought to vary; but it appears to me that that which consists
of a tax upon individuals ought to have no reference to the place of
their residence; it should either be equal, or, if it varies at all, it
should be in proportion to their means of bearing the tax.”</p>

</div>

<p>Being asked whether, if a uniform rate of twopence
were imposed on all letters, and if a person at Limerick
got his letters for twopence, a person at Barnet would
not soon find out that he ought to have his letters for a
penny, Mr. Loyd answered:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If such be the fact, he would soon find it out, I presume; if it
was not the fact, of course he would never find it out.”<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Dillon made the following remarkable statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To show how little the cost of transit sometimes enters into the
price of goods, I may mention to the committee, in the way of
illustration, that we buy goods in Manchester; they are conveyed
to London; we sell them in London very often to dealers resident
in Manchester, who again carry them back to the place from whence
they came, and after the cost of two transits, they will have bought
them of us cheaper than they themselves could have bought them in
Manchester. In this instance, the cost of transit, as an element of
price, has become absolutely destroyed by the force of capital and
other arrangements.”<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Maberly would like a uniform rate of
postage, but did not think it practicable. “Any
arrangements which, in the great details of Post
Office matters, introduce simplicity, he looks upon as
a great improvement.”<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Most of the other Post Office
authorities liked the idea of a uniform rate, as “it
would very much facilitate all the operations of the
Post Office.”<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The feasibility of payment in advance, now the
almost universal practice, was the subject of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
inquiry. Most of the witnesses from the Post Office
recognised the advantage of the arrangement, though
some of them doubted its practicability. Part of this
difficulty, it must be admitted, was, in some sort, of
my own creating; for, perceiving that the costly system
of accounting rendered necessary by payment on delivery
could never be entirely set aside unless prepayment
became universal, my first notion had been to
make this compulsory; and though, to smooth the
difficulties, I recommended that in the outset an
option should be allowed,—that, namely, which exists
at present,—I certainly looked upon this as but a
temporary expedient, and both desired and expected
that the period of probation might be short. Doubtless
it was a mistake, though a very natural one, so to
clog my plan; my aim, however, was not to establish a
pleasing symmetry, but to attain an important practical
end.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General and the Secretary were
both of opinion that the public would not like prepayment.
Being called on to reply to objections on
this point, I showed that the question for the public
to determine was between prepayment at a low rate
and post-payment at a high rate; and I ventured to
predict that, when so considered, the objection to
prepayment would speedily die away; the more so as
the difference proposed to be made between the two
modes of payment, viz., that between one penny and
twopence, was not adopted “as an artificial means of
enforcing prepayment,” but arose “out of the greater
economy to the Post Office of the one arrangement
as compared with the other.” Nearly twenty other
witnesses were examined on the same point, all supporting
my view, some going so far as to advise that
compulsory prepayment should be established at once;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and, indeed, the ease with which prepayment became
the general, nay almost universal, custom, must make
it seem wonderful that its adoption should ever have
been considered as presenting serious difficulties.</p>

<p>Supposing prepayment to be resolved on, the question
remained as to the mode in which such payment
could be most conveniently and safely made; and this
inquiry of course brought the use of stamps into full
discussion. It must be remembered that in proposing
by this plan to supersede the multitudinous accounts
then kept in the department, my object had been not
merely to save expense, but to prevent loss through
negligence or by fraud. In relation to this, the
committee found important evidence in the Eighteenth
Report of the Commissioners of Revenue Enquiry, as
appears by the following extracts given in the report
of the committee:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon the taxation of letters in the evening there is no check.</p>

<p>“The species of control which is exercised over the deputy postmasters
is little more than nominal.”</p>

</div>

<p>Upon this unsatisfactory state of things it appeared
by the evidence of the Accountant-General of the Post
Office that very little improvement had been made
since the issue of the Commissioners’ Report.</p>

<p>Another matter of anxiety relative to the use of
stamps was the risk of their forgery; and on this
point Mr. John Wood, the Chairman of the Board of
Stamps and Taxes, together with other officers of the
department, was examined at considerable length.
Mr. Wood wished to superadd to the use of stamps
that of some paper of peculiar manufacture, forgery
being more difficult when it requires the combined
talents of the engraver, the printer, and the paper-maker.
Specimens of such a paper had been laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
before the committee by Mr. Dickinson, and such a
paper, with lines of thread or silk stretched through
it, Mr. Wood regarded as the best preventive of
forgery he had ever seen. I scarcely need say that
this is the paper which was subsequently used in the
stamped envelope, though its use was afterwards
abandoned as unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Post Office opinions as to the use of stamps
for the purpose of prepayment were, on the whole,
favourable; though the Secretary was of opinion that,
as regards time, labour, and expenditure at the General
Post Office, the saving would not be so great as “Mr.
Hill in his pamphlet seemed to think it would.”<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> He
enumerated nine classes of letters to which he thought
stamps would be inapplicable.</p>

<p>The task of replying to these objections was easy,
on some points ludicrously so; thus solemn reference
was made to the class of letters which, not having
found the party addressed, had been returned through
the Dead Letter Office to the sender. The additional
postage so caused could not be prepaid in stamps. Of
course not, but luckily no such postage had ever been
charged.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Another class of letters presenting a difficulty (here
I am careful to quote the exact words) “would be half-ounce
letters weighing an ounce or above.” I could
not but admit that letters exhibiting so remarkable a
peculiarity might present difficulties with which I was
not prepared to deal.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>“The ninth class,” said the Secretary, “is packets
improperly sent through the Post Office. You may
send anything now if you pay the postage.”</p>

<p>What could be more obvious than the answer? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
gave it as follows: “The fact is, you may send anything
now, whether you pay the postage or not.”<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>But the Secretary continued, “The committee is
aware that there is no prohibition as to what description
of packets persons should put into the Post
Office; the only protection to the Post Office at present
is the postage that would be charged on such
packets.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>My answer was easy: “The fact is, that ‘the only
protection’ is no protection at all. The Post Office
may charge, certainly, but it cannot oblige any one
to pay; and the fact of there being a deduction in the
Finance Accounts for 1837, amounting to £122,000,
for refused, missent, and redirected letters, and so
forth, shows that the Post Office is put to a considerable
expense for which it obtains no remuneration
whatever.”</p>

<p>Among the advantages claimed for the proposed use
of stamps was the moral benefit of the arrangement;
and this was strongly urged by Sir William Brown,
who had seen the demoralising effect arising from
intrusting young men with money to pay the postage,
which, under the existing arrangement, his house was
frequently obliged to do.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> His view was supported by
other witnesses.</p>

<p>It seems strange now that it should ever have been
thought necessary to inquire gravely into the expediency
of substituting a simple charge by weight for
the complicated arrangement already mentioned. But
the innovation was stoutly resisted, and had to be
justified; evidence therefore was taken on the question.
Lord Ashburton being called on for his opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
thought that the mode in use was “a hard mode, an
unjust mode, and vexatious in its execution.”<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, though the Secretary admitted
the frequent occurrence of mistakes, which indeed it
must have been impracticable to avoid, viz., “that a
great number of letters are charged as double and
treble which are not so, and give rise to returns of
postage,”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and though Sir Edward Lees thought “that
charging by weight would, to a certain extent, prevent
letters being stolen in their passage through the Post
Office,”<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> yet most of the witnesses from the Post
Office were unfavourable to taxing by weight. The
Superintending President described an experiment
made at the office, from which he concluded that a
greater number of letters could be taxed in a given
time on the plan then in use, than by charging them in
proportion to the weight of each letter. The value of
this test was pretty well shown by the fact that in this
experiment the weighing was not by the proposed half-ounce,
but by the <i>quarter</i>-ounce scale, and that nearly
every letter was put into the scale unless its weight
was palpable to the hand.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The probable effect of the adoption of my plan on
the expenditure of the Post Office department was a
question likely to elicit opposite opinions. It was to
be considered, for instance, whether the staff then employed
in the London Inland Office, viz., four hundred
and five persons,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> would suffice for that increase of
correspondence on which I counted; or whether, again,
supposing the increase not to be attained, it would,
through economy of arrangement, admit of serious
reduction. On these questions<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> there was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
difference of opinion, even within the office. Thus,
while one high official stated that payment in advance,
even though it occasioned no increase of letters, would
not enable the Post Office to dispense with a single
clerk or messenger,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> another was of opinion that four
times the number of letters might be undertaken by
the present number of hands.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Again, as to the sufficiency of the existing means of
conveyance, the Superintendent of the Mail-coaches,
after stating “that a mail-coach would carry of mail
fifteen hundredweight, or one thousand six hundred
and eighty pounds, represented that if the letters were
increased to the extent assumed, the present mail-coaches
would be unable to carry them;”<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> while
Colonel Colby stated that the first circumstance which
drew his attention to the cheapening of postage was
that in travelling all over the kingdom, particularly
towards the extremities, he had “observed that the
mails and carriages which contained the letters formed
a very stupendous machinery for the conveyance of a
very small weight; that, in fact, if the correspondence
had been doubled or trebled, or quadrupled, it could
not have affected the expense of conveyance.”<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>To determine the question the committee directed a
return to be made of the weight of the mail actually
carried by the several mail-coaches going out of
London. The average was found to be only 463
pounds,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> or little more than a quarter of the weight
which, according to Post Office evidence, a mail-coach
would carry; and as it appeared, by other evidence,
that the chargeable letters must form less than one-tenth
of the weight of the whole mail, it was calculated
by the committee that, with every allowance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
additional weight of bags, the average weight of the
chargeable letters might be increased twenty-four fold
before the limit of 1,680 pounds would be reached. It
was further shown that the weight of all the chargeable
letters contained in the thirty-two mails leaving London
was but 1,456 pounds; that is, less than the weight
which a single mail-coach could carry.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Though the amount to be recommended as the
uniform rate was of course a question for the consideration
of the committee, yet, as my plan fixed it
at one penny, most of the witnesses assumed this as
the contemplated change, making it the basis of their
estimates, and counting upon this low rate for turning
into the regular channel of the post various communications
then habitually made by other means—such, for
instance, as small orders, letters of advice, remittances,
policies of insurance, and letters enclosing patterns and
samples, all of which were, for the most part, diverted
into irregular channels by the excessive postage. Similar
expectations were held out with respect to letters between
country attorneys and their London agents,
documents connected with magisterial and county
jurisdiction, and with various local trusts and commissions
for the management of sewers, harbours,
and roads, and of schools and charities, together with
notices of meetings and elections to be held by joint-stock
and proprietary bodies.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The mere enumeration
will surprise the reader of the present day, accustomed
as he must be to send and receive all such communications
by the post alone. Nor will it seem less
strange to learn that at that time the post had little to
do with the circulation of prices current, catalogues of
sales, prospectuses, circulars, and other documents
issued by public institutions for the promotion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
religion, literature, science, public instruction, or
philanthropic or charitable ends; all of which, so far
as they could then be circulated at all, were obliged
to find their way through channels more or less
irregular.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The committee, however, “also took evidence as to
the increase that was to be expected in the posted
correspondence of the country from the adoption of
a uniform rate of twopence;” but on this basis they
found that much greater diversity of opinion prevailed.
Some important witnesses, however, with Lord Ashburton
at their head, “were, for the sake of protecting
the revenue, favourable to a plan founded on a twopenny
rate.”<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>While, however, Lord Ashburton thought the reduction
to twopence, rather than to a penny, safer as
regards the direct revenue of the Post Office, he was
strong in his opinion that reduction of postage would
act beneficially on the general revenue of the country,
saying that there was “no item of revenue from the
reduction of which he should anticipate more benefit
than he would from the reduction of postage;” and
adding that “if, under any plan of reduction, you did
not find an improvement in the Post Office revenue,
you would find considerable benefit in every other
way.”<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Although it was obvious that the establishment of a
low rate of postage would of itself have a strong
tendency to the disuse of the franking privilege, the
committee had to consider how far it might be desirable
to retain that privilege at all. It was found that
the yearly number of franked missives was about seven
millions; that those franked by members of parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
(somewhat less than five millions in number) might be
counted nearly as double letters, the official franks
(about two millions in number) as eight-fold letters,
and the copies of the statutes, distributed by public
authority (about seventy-seven thousand in number),
thirteen-fold letters.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>In respect of the official franks, indeed, supposing
their contents to be always in genuine relation to the
public service, there was a mere formal difference
between their passing through the Post Office free,
and their being charged to the office of state from
which they were posted; but such a supposition would
have been very wide of the truth, for, as is justly
remarked in the Report, “it is liable to the abuse,
which no vigilance can effectually guard against, of
being made the vehicle for private correspondence.”
The Report continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus it appears from Dr. Lardner’s evidence, that while he
resided in Dublin, the greater part, if not the whole, of his correspondence
was allowed to pass under the franks of the then Postmaster-General
for Ireland, and that the extensive correspondence in
which he is now engaged, in relation to various publications, and to
engineering, on which he is professionally consulted, is carried on
principally by means of official franks. He states that, as these
franks enable him to send any weight he pleases, he is in the habit,
in order to save trouble to those from whom he obtains the franks,
of enclosing under one cover a bundle of letters to the same neighbourhood.”<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

</div>

<p>However the objection to the existence of such
opportunities might be lessened in the particular case
by the uses to which it was applied, there was clearly
no ground for supposing that it was only for such
laudable purposes that the privilege was employed;
indeed, it was notorious that men of science were far
from being the class principally indulged. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
could it be the poor and humble to whom the favour
was commonly extended, but, as alleged by one of the
witnesses, it was “principally the rich and independent
who endeavoured to obtain franks from those who are
privileged to give them.” Dr. Lardner, too, said that
“a man to obtain such advantages as he obtains must
be a person known to or connected with the aristocratic
classes of society.”<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Besides considering my plan, the committee had to
deal with various other suggestions, the principal of
these being “a graduated scale of reduced rates,
commencing with twopence, and extending up to
twelvepence, tantamount, as was stated, in England,
to a reduction of threepence per letter, which was laid
before the committee by Colonel Maberly.” The loss
to the revenue from such reduction he estimated at
from seven to eight hundred thousand pounds a
year.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> None of these plans, however, except one for
charging the rates according to geographical distance,
were approved of by any of the witnesses unconnected
with the Post Office.</p>

<p>As regards the importance of those additional facilities
in reference alike to the convenience of the public
and the restoration of the revenue, upon which I had
laid such stress, but which unfortunately were so
tardily adopted, much confirmatory evidence came
alike from the Post Office and from other quarters.</p>

<p>The postmaster of Manchester stated that “letters
have, in numerous instances, been sent in coach
parcels, not so much with a view to save postage
as to facilitate transmission, and to insure early delivery.
This happens,” he stated, “very much in
those neighbourhoods in which there is not direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
communication through the medium of the Post Office,
especially in a populous and manufacturing district
between twenty and thirty miles from Manchester.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
In confirmation of the latter remark, Mr. Cobden
stated that in the village of Sabden, twenty-eight
miles from Manchester, where his print-works were,
although there was a population of twelve thousand
souls, there was no Post Office, nor anything that
served for one.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the multitudinous statements
made to the committee, in reply to questions, nearly
twelve thousand in number, addressed to the various
witnesses. The recital throws at least some light upon
the difficulties by which the way to postal reform was
beset, showing how necessary it was then to strengthen
points which now seem quite unassailable, to prove
what now seems self-evident, to induce acceptance of
what no one now would hear of abandoning.</p>

<p>If further illustration of such necessity be needed,
it may be found in the following extracts from the
evidence of Post Office officials:—</p>

<p>The Assistant Secretary:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Question 986. I think there are quite as many letters written
now as there would be even if the postage were reduced [to one
penny].”<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It having been stated that the time for posting
letters at the London receiving offices had been extended
from 5 to 6 p.m., Mr. Holgate, President of
the Inland Office, is examined as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Question 1,586. <i>Chairman.</i> Has any notice of that been conveyed
to the public?—I should be very sorry if any had.</p>

<p>“1,587. How long has that been [the practice]?—The last three
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“1,588. Why should you regret that being made public?—They
would reach us so much later, and throw so much upon the last half-hour
in the evening.</p>

<p>“1,589. That is the time when the office is most pressed by
business?—Yes.</p>

<p>“1,590. <i>Mr. Currie</i> [a member of the committee]. In fact, the
office has given the public an accommodation which the office is
anxious that the public should not profit by?”<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“1,655. If Mr Hill’s plan were carried into effect, I do not
think that any tradesman could be got to receive letters [<i>i.e.</i>, to keep
a receiving-house] under £100 year.”<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Postmaster-General:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Question 2,821. He [Mr. Hill] anticipates only an increase of
five and a quarter-fold [to make up the gross revenue]; it will require
twelve-fold on our calculation.... Therefore it comes to
that point, which is right and which is wrong: I maintain that our
calculations are more likely to be right than his.”<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It may be remarked here that the gross revenue
rather more than recovered itself in the year 1851,
the increase of letters being then only four and
three-quarters-fold.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>My own examination occupied a considerable portion
of six several days, my task being not only to state
and enforce my own views, but to reply to objections
raised by such of the Post Office authorities as were
against the proposed reform. This list comprised—with
the exception of Mr. Peacock, the solicitor,—all
the highest officials in the chief office; and however
unfortunate their opposition, and however galling I
felt it at the time, I must admit on retrospect that,
passing over the question of means employed, their
resistance to my bold innovation was very natural.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Its adoption must have been dreaded by men of
routine, as involving, or seeming to involve, a total
derangement of proceeding—an overthrow of established
order; while the immediate loss of revenue—inevitable
from the manner in which alone the change
could then be introduced (all gradual or limited reform
having by that time been condemned by the public
voice), a loss, moreover, greatly exaggerated in the
minds of those who could not or did not see the
means direct and indirect of its recuperation, must
naturally have alarmed the appointed guardians of
this branch of the national income. If, as the evidence
proceeded, they began to question the wisdom of their
original decision, they probably thought, at the same
time, that the die was now cast, their course taken, and
all that remained was to maintain their ground as best
they could. The nature and extent of Post Office
resistance, much as has appeared already, is most
conspicuous in the following extracts—the last I shall
make—from the Digest of Evidence, in which are
summed up the opinions put forth by Colonel Maberly,
the Secretary; opinions from which, so far as I am
aware, he never receded:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He considers the whole scheme of Mr. Hill as utterly fallacious;
he thought so from the first moment he read the pamphlet of
Mr. Hill; and his opinion of the plan was formed long before the
evidence was given before the committee. The plan appears to him
a most preposterous one, utterly unsupported by facts, and resting
entirely on assumption. Every experiment in the way of reduction
which has been made by the Post Office has shown its fallacy; for every
reduction whatever leads to a loss of revenue, in the first instance:
if the reduction be small, the revenue recovers itself; but if the
rates were to be reduced to a penny, revenue would not recover
itself for forty or fifty years.”</p>

</div>

<p>The divisions on the two most important of the
resolutions submitted to the Committee, and, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the ultimate result of their deliberations, show that the
efforts that had been made had all been needed.</p>

<p>Thus, on a motion made on July 17th by Mr. Warburton
to recommend the establishment of a uniform
rate of inland postage between one post town and
another, the Committee was equally divided; the
“ayes” being Mr. Warburton, Lord Lowther, Mr.
Raikes Currie, and Mr. Chalmers; the “noes,” the
three members of Government, Mr. P. Thomson,
Lord Seymour, and Mr. Parker, with Mr. Thornley,
M.P. for Wolverhampton; so that the motion was
affirmed only by the casting vote of the Chairman.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Warburton further moving:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it is the opinion of this committee, that upon any large
reduction being made in the rates of inland postage, it would be
expedient to adopt an uniform rate of one penny per half-ounce,
without regard to distance,”—</p>

</div>

<p>the motion was rejected by six to three; the “ayes”
being Mr. Warburton, Mr. Raikes Currie, and Mr.
Morgan J. O’Connell; and the “noes” the same as
before, with the addition of Lord Lowther and Mr. G.
W. Wood; and upon Mr. Warburton, when thus far
defeated, moving to recommend a uniform postage of
three-halfpence, the motion was again lost by six to
four, the only change being that Mr. Chalmers, who
appears to have been absent during the second division,
now again voted with the ayes.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The second day, however, Mr. Warburton returned
to the charge, moving to recommend a uniform rate of
twopence the half-ounce, increasing at the rate of one
penny for each additional half-ounce; a motion met, not
by a direct negative, as before, but by an amendment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
tantamount to one. On this question, as also on that of
uniformity, the committee was equally divided. Again,
therefore, the motion was affirmed only by the casting
vote of the Chairman.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The passing of the two
resolutions, however—one to recommend a uniform
rate of inland postage irrespective of distance, and
the other to fix the single rate at twopence—was
decisive as to the committee’s course, as will appear
by the sequel. We must return for a time to the
rejected amendment.</p>

<p>This had been moved by Mr. P. Thomson, and the
substance of it was to abandon the recommendation
of a uniform rate and to consider instead a Report
proposed by Lord Seymour, the chief points of which
were to recommend the maintenance of the charge
by distance and the establishment of a rate varying
from one penny, for distances under fifteen miles, to
one shilling for distances above two hundred miles, or
of some similar scale. <i>This, it must be observed, would
have been adopted as the recommendation of the committee
but for the casting vote of the Chairman, Mr. Wallace.</i>
To what extent so untoward a circumstance would
have retarded the cause of postal reform it would be
difficult now even to conjecture; but it cannot be
doubted that the success, which, even with the support
of the committee, was so hardly achieved, would at
least have undergone long and injurious delay.</p>

<p>To make this clear, it must be observed that by the
adoption of Lord Seymour’s draft Report (a copy of
which I have before me) not only the recommendations
for uniformity and decided reduction of postage would
have been set aside, but also those for increased facilities,
for the general use of stamps, and for charge by
weight instead of by the number of enclosures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Seymour’s Report, however, though so unsatisfactory
in its recommendations, and, according
to my view, very erroneous in its reasonings on many
points (more especially in its main argumentation,
viz., that against uniformity), yet contained passages
of great use to me at the time, as confirming my statements,
and more or less directly supporting my views;
particularly as regards the evils which high rates of
postage brought upon the poor, the vast extent of
illicit conveyance, the evils of the frank system, and
even many of the advantages of a uniform charge.
Doubtless, had the recommendations contained in
this Report been voluntarily adopted by the Post
Office only two years before, almost every one of
them would have been received as a grace; but it
was now too late, their sum total being altogether too
slight to make any approach towards satisfying the
expectations which had subsequently arisen.</p>

<p>Before quite leaving Lord Seymour’s Report, I must,
in candour, admit that on one point his prediction was
truer than my own, though, as my own remained
unpublished, I was not committed to it. The following
is the passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears that the great change which must result from the
substitution of railways for mails [mail-coaches] will have the effect
of increasing considerably the cost of conveying the correspondence
of the country.”</p>

</div>

<p>In my copy of this draft Report (given to me, I
suppose, by Mr. Wallace) I find the following remark
in my own handwriting:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No such thing. One railway stands in place of several common
roads.”</p>

</div>

<p>The implied inference, viz., that the cheaper operation
of railways would lower the cost of conveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the mails seemed justified by the moderation of the
charges for this service made up to that time by the
railway companies. The event, however, has contradicted
my contradiction, the railway charges for conveying
the mails, unlike the rates for passengers and
goods, being higher, weight for weight, than those on
the old mail roads.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The committee having thus decided the two great
points of uniformity—rate and a twopenny charge
for the single letter,—Mr. Wallace, with his usual
kindness, immediately wrote to inform me of the
result. He was the more careful to do this because,
as he knew, it was not in full accordance with my
wish, the rate recommended being higher than that
which I regarded as desirable; and, what was worse,
such as to make strict uniformity impracticable; since
reservation would have to be made in favour of the
local penny rates then in existence, which could not
be raised without exciting overpowering dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>To return to the committee: only one further
attempt was made to modify their resolution, viz.,
by a motion made at the next meeting by Lord
Seymour, in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it is the opinion of this committee that an increase of
general post letters under an uniform rate of twopence, to the extent
which will be required to sustain the gross revenue of the Post
Office, will occasion a considerable addition to the cost of the establishment.”</p>

</div>

<p>After this day the members of Government ceased
to attend, save only that Lord Seymour once reappeared
during the consideration of the Report.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Opposition being thus abandoned, proceedings went on
rapidly, so that at the next meeting the whole of the
remaining resolutions, more than twenty in number,
were all carried; the Chairman being requested also
to draw up a Report in conformity therewith.</p>

<p>As the proceedings of the committee approached
their close, Mr. Wallace requested that I would undertake
to prepare a draft Report for his consideration,
previously to its being submitted to the Committee.
From this I naturally shrank; but, upon further
urgency, I so far consented as to select so much of
the evidence as seemed most necessary for the purpose,
cutting it out from the reports just as it stood, in
question and answer, but classifying it under some
twenty different heads. This, according to my recollection,
I placed in Mr. Wallace’s hands, and upon it
he wrote a Report. I must here mention, however,
that though this Report became the basis of that
finally issued, it was by no means the same document,
having been re-arranged, in great measure re-written,
and greatly added to, during the recess. Of this more
hereafter.</p>

<p>Thus closed, for the present, the work of this
memorable committee, on whose decision rested consequences,
not only of the deepest interest to myself,
but, as afterwards appeared, of importance to the
whole civilized world. Seldom, I believe, has any
committee worked harder. I must add that Mr.
Wallace’s exertions were unsparing, his toil incessant,
and his zeal in the cause unflagging. My own convictions
in relation to the committee and its chairman
were corroborated by the following strong passage in
the <i>Times</i>:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Altogether we regard the Post Office Enquiry as one conducted
with more honesty and more industry than any ever brought before
a committee of the House of Commons.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps, before proceeding to other matters, I may,
without invidiousness, make one more remark in reference
to the proceedings of this committee. It is
not unknown that since the successful establishment
of penny postage, there have appeared other claimants
to its authorship. As regards Mr. Wallace, enough
has been said to show that he was not of the number;
though of late some persons, trusting perhaps to
imperfect recollections, have advanced such claims in
his name. As regards other claimants, it is most
remarkable that throughout this period of contest—when
no less than eighty-seven witnesses deposed in
favour of the measure, and when all solid information
and every weighty opinion were so valuable, when
even the principle of uniformity of rate was considered
of such doubtful expediency that it was carried only by
the casting vote of the chairman, while the penny rate
was actually rejected in favour of one of twopence,—they
gave no evidence, remained unheard, and were,
so far as has ever appeared, entirely silent. General
Colby, indeed, on whose behalf some such claim has
been advanced since his death, did give evidence, but
without the least reference to further discoveries by himself
beyond what has been already mentioned;<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and I
may add, that though he honoured me with his friendship
to the time of his death, he never even alluded to the
claim in question. Indeed, all the claims of which the
public has lately heard are of very recent date, having
arisen long since the success of penny postage became
indisputable.</p>

<p>The Report adopted at the last meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
committee was placed in the hands of Mr. Warburton
for revision; a work to which he forthwith applied
himself with untiring zeal, referring occasionally to
me for some detail of information, or for the verification
of some calculation. I had therefore frequent
occasion to call on him. I should not forget
to add that in the successful introduction of postal
reform his able, earnest, and continuous assistance
played not merely an important, but an essential
part.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> In all my visits to his house I was received in
the dining-room. I well remember the appearance of
things—an appearance which never varied from first to
last. What first struck me was that the room never
could be used according to its name; the table, indeed,
stood out in full length, sufficient for a respectable
number of guests, but it was wholly occupied with
piles of books, and those not of the most digestible
kind, consisting almost entirely of such as in passing
through the Post Office are marked Par. Pro., and are
known to all the world as “blue books.” The sideboard
was similarly heaped, save that a little room was
left for astronomical instruments, Mr. Warburton being
an able mathematician. The chairs, save one, bore
each its parliamentary load, and similar lumber occupied
the floor; passages only, and those narrow ones,
being left between the paper walls. There were,
however, one or two books of a lighter kind; but even
these seemed insensible of change. On an early visit
I laid hands on a number of the “Edinburgh Review,”
containing one of Macaulay’s brilliant articles; and as
the book always remained exactly where I laid it down,
I found opportunity of reading, bit by bit, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
essay. The one chair already mentioned, and a small
table near it, were alone unencumbered with books,
and alone free from the dust which, in every other
part of the room, seemed to have on it the repose of
years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, having but inferential knowledge as to
the progress of the work, and thinking it very important
that no time should be lost in publishing the
Report, since I hoped it might be advantageously
dealt with in the newspapers during the recess, I felt
a certain degree of impatience at what I supposed
must prove but laborious refinement. In this feeling
Mr. Wallace more than fully shared. In the course of
the autumn he wrote to me, in earnest protest against
the delay, his expressions growing stronger as time
advanced, until on December 1st he went so far as to
predict that, if the Report were withheld during the
vacation, penny postage would not be carried out
during the next year. He even begged that his
letters might be kept as vouchers of his anxiety on
the subject. In the end, however, it became clear
enough that no time had really been lost, the delay
being more than atoned for by the excellence of the
result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, too, the press, not awaiting the appearance
of the Report, began to urge action by reference
to what was already known. The <i>Times</i>, in particular,
repeatedly wrote in strong support of my plan.</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned the more important
events occurring between the prorogation of Parliament
in August and the end of the year 1838, it will
be seen that, so far as postal affairs were concerned,
this was to me a period of comparative rest, though
even then scarcely a week, or perhaps even a day,
passed without their making some call on my attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Of course, too, my duties at the Australian
Commission remained undiminished, or rather, indeed,
increased with the increasing flow of emigration, and
the difficulties already arising in the colony. However,
I was again able to breathe, and to prepare for
those new anxieties which I knew must be in the
future. When would the Report appear? What
effect would it produce on the country? Would there
be such a movement as would sufficiently influence
ministers and Parliament? To me, of course, these
were questions of the deepest interest, and though, for
the time, the main work was, as it were, taken off my
hands, yet it was necessary to keep watch, to be ready
for assistance when called for, to deal with almost
innumerable communications, and to pay attention to
the numerous suggestions that were made. So closed
the year 1838.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">PENNY POSTAGE BILL.</span></h3>

<p>The first circumstance that I have to record in
1839 was the receipt of a letter from Sir William
Brown,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> written from Washington, and informing me
of an interview which he had had with the Postmaster-General
of the United States on the subject of my
pamphlet. The Postmaster-General told him that it
had afforded him a great deal of information, and
further that it was the intention of the United States
Government to remodel the Post Office laws in the
next session of Congress, and that he thought five
cents for all distances would be a postage sufficient
to cover expenses. This rate was afterwards adopted,
though subsequently the charge was yet further reduced.
Sir William gave it as his own opinion that
the action of the American Government would materially
assist the movement at home. Three weeks
later, however, he wrote expressing his opinion that
my best course would be to write to the Hon. Mr.
Kennedy, who was very desirous of moving in the
matter, and to whom it was wished that I should send
the reports, pamphlets, &amp;c., bearing upon the subject.
In writing to this gentleman, I expressed an opinion
that on account of the great extent of territory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the sparseness of population in the United States,
penny postage might not be so applicable to that
country as to England; but added that, as the
American people did not look to their Post Office
for revenue, I thought the general rate, even if not
reduced to a penny, might yet be a low one.</p>

<p>The Report so laboriously prepared by Mr. Warburton
appeared, I believe, early in March.</p>

<p>Of this Report (the third of the Committee of
1838) I forbear to give even a summary; not only
because this would involve the repetition of much that
has been already said, but because I have no hope
whatever of doing justice to so very able a document,
the result of many months of hard labour, the very
model of a Report, and which, as such, will even now
amply repay the trouble of perusal. It is invaluable
as an authoritative record of a state of things so
absurdly strange as to be now almost incredible, but
which was nevertheless justified and upheld at the
time by many able and excellent men. Moreover, its
elaborate calculations, which I was called upon to
check, put some of the most important questions at
issue in a clear, striking, and often even amusing light.
On all important points it gave to my statements and
conclusions the sanction of its powerful authority.
Nevertheless, as the committee had determined on the
recommendation of a twopenny rate, the Report had
to be framed in, at least, formal accordance with
this fact; though both Mr. Wallace, in whose name it
went to the committee, and Mr. Warburton, by whom
it was actually drawn, were strongly in favour of the
penny rate. A careful perusal of the document, however,
will show that, though the twopenny rate is
formally recommended, the penny rate is the one
really suggested for adoption. In this sense it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
understood by the public, and to my knowledge it was
wished that it should be so understood. It only
remained to see what effect this masterly Report
would have on the country, the Parliament, and the
Government. As respects the first, enough has been
mentioned to justify good expectation; the same might
be said in a less degree of the second; but of the third,
all indications were as yet adverse.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April appeared, in some of the
London papers, a letter which I had felt called upon
to write in reply to an article in the Supplement to
McCulloch’s “Commercial Dictionary,” then lately published,
extracts from which had appeared in some of
the newspapers. Mr. McCulloch’s opposition came very
unexpectedly, since he had previously been a decided
supporter of the general plan; his name having appeared
amongst the select signatures to the important
London petition presented to Parliament in the year
1837, and already mentioned at page 289 of this
history. He had likewise supported the cause in the
<i>Courier</i> newspaper, resented the delay in adopting
my plan, had, in conversation with myself, strongly
condemned the Ministers, and threatened to expose
them in the “Edinburgh Review.” The only circumstance
to which I could attribute his change of
opinion was that he had recently been appointed head
of the Stationery Department. We all know, and I
myself have been charged with such experience, that
questions often assume a new aspect when viewed
from the windows of a Government office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, meetings were taking place in various
towns to petition in favour of penny postage, and
strong articles on the same side appeared in many of
the leading newspapers. Mr. Wallace, as chairman of
the late committee, received so many letters on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
subject of the movement, as to be under the necessity
of publicly acknowledging them <i>en masse</i>, mentioning,
by way of instance, that on the single day of writing
he had received nine written communications in reference
to various petitions, together with eight
newspapers.</p>

<p>The Post Office, too, began to show signs of uneasiness,
and made a few very cautious reductions;
lowering, for instance, the postage between London
and Keswick from thirteen pence to a shilling, and
granting similar indulgence on London letters to
twenty-one other places; the amount of reduction
being in each instance the same, or, as the “Post
Circular”<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> put it, not <i>to</i> a penny, but <i>by</i> a penny.</p>

<p>On March 23rd a somewhat remarkable scene occurred
in the House of Commons; Mr. Scholefield
having presented a petition from Birmingham, for
which he was member, the Speaker desired all honourable
members who had petitions to present on Penny
Postage to bring them up; when instantly a great
number of members on both sides of the House
“advanced in a crowd to present them, amidst cheering
on all sides.” The petitions on the subject in the
course of six days amounted to two hundred and
fifteen.</p>

<p>The number of the “Post Circular” from which I
have taken this account (No. 12) contains, also, one of
those amusing devices with which my friend Mr.
Henry Cole knew so well how to strike the public
eye. Probably the reader will not be displeased at its
reproduction. The Edinburgh mail coach, it will be
seen, is depicted, with its guard, coachman, and two
outside passengers; the letter bags—which, as all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
world knows, or then knew, usually occupied the hind
boot, so as to lie under the guard’s foot—are by an
artistic liberty placed on the roof, the whole being
arranged in divisions of franks, newspapers, Stamp-office
parcels, and chargeable letters; the first three
(which are free of postage) occupy the whole roof, the
last lying in small space on the top of one of the bulky
divisions, the proportions being those of the mail conveyed
on March 2nd, 1838. The legend below sums
up the tale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/mail-coach.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Drawing of an over-loaded Edinburgh mail coach" />
<p class="caption">GREAT WEIGHT AND NO PRICE! LITTLE WEIGHT AND ALL PRICE!!</p>
</div>

<p>The depth and extent of public feeling by this time
aroused are shown by the following extract from the
<i>Times</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such is the degree of conviction which is carried to all who have
bestowed any thought upon it, that the only question is—and it is
asked universally—will these ministers have the honesty and courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
to try it? On a review of the public feeling which it has called
forth, from men of all parties, sects, and conditions of life, it may
well be termed the cause of the whole people of the United Kingdom,
against the small coterie of place-holders in St. Martin’s-le-Grand
and its dependencies.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That the <i>Times</i> did not stand alone, is shown by
a general list in the “Post Circular” of newspapers
which took the same side. Though probably incomplete,
it contains the names of twenty-five London
papers (nine daily and sixteen weekly), and of eighty-seven
provincial papers. It must be remembered, too,
that the number of journals, especially of country
journals, was then comparatively small.</p>

<p>While public feeling was thus manifesting itself at
home, I received further evidence that attention was
excited abroad, Mr. Hume sending me a pamphlet
written by M. Piron, then second in authority in the
Post Office of France, advocating reduction of postage,
and speaking of my plan in very flattering terms.
The rate recommended by M. Piron was twenty
centimes the quarter-ounce, or, setting aside the
difference of weight, nearly the same as that previously
recommended here by the Parliamentary Committee.
M. Piron, I may here remark, continued to press his
views on the French Government (at one time, I
was assured, to his own injury) till my plan, in a
modified form, was adopted by the Revolutionary
Government of 1848.</p>

<p>Now, however, came the crowning proof of the hold
which the plan had taken of the public mind. On one
of the first days in May, Lord Melbourne received a
deputation on the subject, in which were comprised
about one hundred and fifty members of Parliament,
chiefly, if not exclusively, supporters of Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
The principal speaker was Mr. Warburton, his most
telling passage being as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If he might be pardoned for making the observation upon such
an occasion, he would say it would be a concession so wise, that
it would be well calculated to make any Government justly popular,
<i>and he would strongly urge it as a measure which a Liberal party had
a just right to expect from a Liberal administration</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Mr. O’Connell, mounting on a chair in a distant part
of the room, spoke as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One word for Ireland, my Lord. My poor countrymen do not
smuggle, for the high postage works a total prohibition to them.
They are too poor to find out secondary conveyances, and if you
shut the Post Office to them, which you do now, you shut out warm
hearts and generous affections from home, kindred, and friends.
Consider, my Lord, that a letter to Ireland and the answer back
would cost thousands upon thousands of my poor and affectionate
countrymen considerably more than a fifth of their week’s wages;
and let any gentleman here ask himself what would be the influence
upon his correspondence if, for every letter he wrote, he or his
family had to pay one-fifth of a week’s income.”</p>

</div>

<p>Next came Mr. Hume; his voice, as that of the
watchful guardian of the national finances, carrying
unusual weight, since it was known to everybody that
he would be the last man to recommend any
improvident course.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable speech, the concluding
one, was that of Mr. Moffatt, who undertook, if
Government shrank from the risk of the proposed
reduction, to form a City company which should
take the Post Office entirely off their hands, guaranteeing
to the State the same amount of revenue as
before.</p>

<p>Lord Melbourne’s reply, though reserved, was
courteous and encouraging. He recognised the importance
of the deputation, acknowledged the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the facts produced, and while he withheld all present
announcement as to the course to be adopted by
Government, promised that the whole matter should
receive prompt and earnest attention.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A strong feeling evidently pervaded the room in reference to
Mr. Warburton’s allusion to the just expectation of this important
measure being conceded by a Liberal Government. <span class="smcap">He was then
loudly cheered.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So remarkable a deputation could not but produce a
great effect. Mr. Warburton’s hint was, as I learnt,
well understood, and I was afterwards assured that this
proceeding was the very turning-point of the movement;
the Government having thereon decided to
adopt the measure. Certainly, but three weeks later,
I received the following letter from Mr. Warburton:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“May 22, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—I have just learnt from Mr. Bannerman, who
has it from Lords Melbourne and Duncannon, that the penny
postage is to be granted.</p>

<p>“I shall see Lord M. and Lord J. R. on Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="center">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Henry Warburton</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Three days later I again heard from Mr. Warburton,
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“May 25, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—Mr. Parker, the Treasury Lord, last night, and
Lord John Russell, this morning, confirmed to me the intentions of
the Government to propose your plan; and I believe that they will
announce publicly their intentions to that effect on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“I shall take an opportunity of expressing my opinion to Lord
Melbourne that you ought to be employed to superintend the
execution of the plan. If you have anything to say to me on the
subject, call before half-past 10 o’clock to-morrow.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Henry Warburton</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>The recommendation that I should be employed had
in my view a double importance; agreeing not only
with my own natural and ardent desire, but also with
the inevitable conviction that if, by the alternative
course, the management of my plan were committed
to the hands of its avowed and persistent opponents—men
who manifestly viewed it not only with dislike
but with scorn, and whose predictions would be falsified
if it attained success—it would have small chance of
receiving that earnest and zealous attention, watchful
care, and constant effort for effectual development
combined with strict economy, on which I knew the
desired result must depend. For convenience I
mention here that after the passing of the Postage
Bill, Mr. Wallace wrote to Lord Melbourne to the
same effect. His letter is but a specimen of Mr.
Wallace’s general course in my regard. He makes
no reference to his own valuable labours, but only
urges claims for me, based on the importance of my
discovery.</p>

<p>To return to my narrative; a few days later,
Mr. Warburton, having in the House asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Secretary of State for the Home Department whether
Government intended to proceed with a twopenny
or penny rate, Lord John Russell replied that the
intention of Government was to propose a resolution
in favour of a uniform penny postage,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> remarking,
“the plan will be in conformity with that which
has been proposed by the committee as likely to be
the most beneficial one,” and adding that, though
the scheme would necessarily involve many months
of preparation, no time should be lost.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Having
been apprised of Mr. Warburton’s intention, I was
present when the announcement was made; and I
leave the reader to imagine the deep gratification
I felt.</p>

<p>Grave doubts yet remained as to whether my plan
would be adopted in its entirety. My first anxiety was
as to the introduction of stamps; their use, as already
shown, being indispensable to that rapidity and
economy of postal operation, without which the mere
adoption of the penny rate would be extremely imperfect
as a matter of public convenience, and perhaps
seriously detrimental to the direct revenue. I consequently
prepared a paper,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> which was printed and
circulated by the Mercantile Committee, “On the
Collection of Postage by means of Stamps.” It
describes in considerable detail the plan of which the
first bare suggestion had been given, as already shown,
early in 1837, and, except that there is no mention of
the Queen’s Head—which was an after-thought—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
describes with considerable accuracy the kinds of stamps
now in use, and the modes of distributing them. The
envelopes and adhesive stamps now so familiar to
all, are described the one as “the little bags called
envelopes,” and the other as “small stamped detached
labels—say about an inch square—which, if prepared
with a glutinous wash on the back, may be attached
without a wafer.”<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> I must admit, however, that, as
the paper shows, I still looked upon stamped covers or
envelopes as the means which the public would most
commonly employ; still believing that the adhesive
stamp would be reserved for exceptional cases.
Unfortunately, the recommendations contained in my
paper were not acted upon until the Government had
resorted to other supposed expedients, which turned
out to be real impediments, and were not got rid of
without much trouble.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Meantime, on June 25th, Lord Radnor, in presenting
forty petitions in favour of uniform penny postage,
repeated Mr. Warburton’s question as to the intentions
of Government, and received from Lord Melbourne
the assurance that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
would shortly bring the matter forward;<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> his words
were as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Undoubtedly it is the intention of the Government to carry into
effect the plan referred to by my noble friend—considering how it
has been recommended, the strong interest it has excited, and the
benefits and advantages which unquestionably belong to it—with all
practicable speed.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In my anxiety to obtain for the proposed measure
a favourable reception in the House of Commons, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
drew up with great care a short paper, entitled “Facts
and Estimates as to the Increase of Letters,” which
was printed by the Mercantile Committee, a copy being
sent to every member of Parliament.</p>

<p>A copy of this document is given in the Appendix
(G). The prediction therein set forth was much longer
in fulfilment than I anticipated—the gross revenue
not having been made up till 1851, the twelfth year
of penny postage. Probably, like most projectors,
I was over-sanguine. Probably also I was unduly
influenced by the evidence proceeding from the public
in support of my recommendations. But the reader
will find from the following narrative that after the
adoption of my plan by the Legislature many circumstances
occurred, which could not possibly have been
foreseen, tending to delay the apparent success of
my scheme of Postal Reform. Among these are the
following:—</p>

<p>1st. Delay in the adoption of stamps, and the still
greater delay in effectually supplying the public therewith.</p>

<p>2nd. While my plan applied to inland postage only,
large reductions were also made in foreign and colonial
postage, which, however right in themselves, of course
had their effect in delaying the time when the amount
of the gross revenue should have recovered itself.</p>

<p>3rd. The additional facilities to be afforded the
public—more especially by a great extension of rural
distribution—though a most important part of my plan,
were, to say the least, for a long time delayed. This
I conceive to have been a main cause of delay in the
recovery of the gross revenue.</p>

<p>4th. Above all, the execution of my plan was,
during the early years of penny postage, entrusted
almost entirely to men whose official reputation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
pledged, not to its success, but to its failure. Even
after I entered the Post Office, near the close of the
seventh year of penny postage, obstacles were so
continually thrown in my way that for many years I
could do comparatively little to promote the measure;
and it was not till the fifteenth year, namely, when I
became Secretary to the Post Office, that I could
exercise any direct influence therein.</p>

<p>About the time that the paper mentioned above
was issued, opposition arose in so strange a quarter,
that if the reader were invited to conjecture, he could
scarcely go right save by considering how best he
could go wrong. If it had been inquired what trade
was most likely to benefit by the multiplication of
letters, surely the one selected would have been the
trade in paper. Nevertheless, a deputation of stationers
went up to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, setting
forth that they and their brethren would be put to
great inconvenience by the adoption of Mr. Rowland
Hill’s plan. Probably the motive to this whimsical
proceeding was an apprehension that the issue by
Government of stamped envelopes would deprive
the petitioners of an expected trade; the fear of this
making them blind to the far more than counterbalancing
advantage to be derived from the multiplication
of that which envelopes were intended to
contain. However, I must not omit to mention that,
some months afterwards, when I was in office, I
had a very satisfactory interview with these same
gentlemen at the Treasury.</p>

<p>On July 5th, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in
bringing forward his Budget, proposed the adoption of
uniform penny postage. After having dwelt upon the
fact that there had been of late a large increase of
expenditure—due partly to improved administration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
home affairs, partly to the establishment of ocean
steamers for the conveyance of the mails, and the
employment for the same purpose of railway trains
instead of mail-coaches, partly to the increase of the
National Debt by the borrowing of the twenty millions
used in the redemption of negro slavery, partly, also, to
an increase in the means of defence, and lastly, to the
recent insurrection in Canada,—he observed that, as
through these various circumstances there was little
or no spare revenue, it would be necessary that the
Government, in yielding to the general wish for the
adoption of penny postage—a measure imperilling a
revenue of a million and a half—must be assured of
the concurrence of the House in the adoption of such
means as might be necessary for making good any
deficiency that might arise; he himself expecting that
in the outset such deficiency would be very great.
After having stated that on some points he differed
from the conclusions of the committee, he proceeded
to eulogise their labours in the following terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I must admit that a committee which took more pains to inform
itself, whose collection of evidence is more valuable, as giving the
opinions of many of the most intelligent persons of all classes in the
country, I never remember in my Parliamentary experience.”<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In reference to the popular demand for the measure,
he made the following remarkable declaration:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I find that the mass of them [the petitions] present the most
extraordinary combination I ever saw of representations to one
purpose from all classes, unswayed by any political motives whatever;
from persons of all shades of opinion, political and religious;
from clergymen of the Established Church, and from all classes of
Protestant Dissenters; from the clergymen of Scotland, from the
commercial and trading communities in all parts of the kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Judiciously thinking that it would be better for
the House to leave the details of the measure in the
hands of Government, he demanded for the Treasury
the power at once of fixing the rates of postage,
of ordering payment by weight, of making prepayment
compulsory, and of establishing the use of
stamps. He concluded by moving the following
Resolution:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it is expedient to reduce the postage on letters to one
uniform rate of a penny postage, according to a certain amount of
weight to be determined; that the Parliamentary privilege of franking
should be abolished; and that official franking be strictly limited—the
House pledging itself to make good any deficiency that may
occur in the revenue from such reduction of the postage.”<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such opposition as was made was directed rather
against the pledge required of the House than against
the plan of penny postage, and on that point Sir
Robert Peel and Mr. Goulbourn were supported by
some members on the Liberal side of the House,
including Mr. Hume, who regarded such pledge as
superfluous, seeing that the House was at all times
bound to maintain the national income. He also
thought that the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s estimate
of deficiency was excessive, he himself believing
that though there might be a serious deficiency the
first, and even the second, year, it was probable that, as
by that time the plan would be in full operation, the
future deficiency would not be greater than Mr. Hill
had allowed for.</p>

<p>All, however, concurred in the opinion that if the
experiment were to be made the penny rate was to be
preferred to any other; and while Mr. Goulbourn said
that he should have been much in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
measure were there but a surplus to justify the risk,
Sir Robert Peel went so far as to say—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That he should have thought it sufficient, if Government had
maturely considered the details of this measure, had calculated the
probable loss to the revenue, and had come forward to propose, in
this acknowledged deficiency of the public revenue, some substitute
to compensate the public. He should have thought that sufficient.
So convinced was he of the moral and social advantages that would
result from the removal of all restrictions on the free communication
by letter, that he should have willingly consented to the proposition.”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was very noticeable at the time that, after citing
the strongly condemnatory opinions of Colonel Maberly
and Lord Lichfield, Sir Robert Peel remarked, “I do
not say that these opinions convince me.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The Resolution was agreed to without division.</p>

<p>A week later, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
having moved that the Report on the Postage Acts
be received, Mr. Goulbourn, who might be regarded
as the Chancellor of the Exchequer expectant, moved
resolutions of which the object was to have the
measure of penny postage postponed, on the ground,
mainly, of the present deficiency in the revenue, the
extensive powers proposed to be given to the Treasury,
and the opposition of the paper-makers.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply, pointed
out several recent instances of partial reduction in
postage rates which had been followed, speedily, by
an increase of revenue, taunted the opposition
members with altered tactics since the last debate,
and challenged them to a direct vote against penny
postage.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel repeated the arguments of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Goulbourn, and again urged objections to the pledge
to make good any loss of revenue.</p>

<p>On the division, the “ayes” were 215, and the
“noes” 113, giving a majority of 102 in favour of
penny postage.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Those who frequented the House of Commons
thirty years ago will remember the two doorkeepers
of the day—Mr. Pratt, a somewhat tall and grave
personage, and Mr. Williams, a chubby red-faced man,
who seemed as if he escaped bursting only by the
relief he found in laughing at the exuberance of his
own humour. Both these men were zealous friends of
penny postage, and, in the warmth of their friendship,
always went at least as far as duty permitted, in
enabling me to attend the discussions on postal
matters. On the night when the division took place
their excitement was prodigious. During the debate I
had sat under the gallery, but on the division had, of
course, to withdraw. As I passed into the outer
lobby, the inner being required in the division, and
used, as it happened, to receive the supporters of the
measure, my two friends warned me to keep near the
door, that they might let me know how things went
on. I took my station accordingly, and ever and anon
was informed through the grating in the door, the flap
being for the moment withdrawn, as to how matters
were going on. Each report was better than the last,
Williams’s eager face beaming at each momentary
glimpse with increased gratification: “All right,”
“Going on capitally,” “Sure of a majority,” were
given out in succession, until the climax was reached
by his whispering audibly, amidst laughter which he
strove in vain to control, “Why, here’s old Sibby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
come out;” and certainly when I learnt that Colonel
Sibthorpe, the Tory of Tories, was amongst the supporters
of my plan, I could not but feel that the game
was won.</p>

<p>The measure was now considered secure so far as
related to the House of Commons, but people had not
yet forgotten the warning given by the ejaculation so
common seven or eight years before, “Thank God,
there’s a House of Lords!” and anxiety began to
arise as to the reception which the measure might
experience in the Upper House. Promptly, therefore,
the Mercantile Committee directed its attention that
way, and appointed certain of its members as a deputation
to wait upon a few of the more influential peers.
In executing this mission, the deputation naturally
sought an interview with the Duke of Wellington;
their application, however, receiving the following
characteristic reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“London, July 16, 1839.</p>

<p>“The Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr.
Moffatt.</p>

<p>“The Duke does not fill any political office. He is not in the
habit of discussing public affairs in private, and he declines to
receive the visits of deputations or individuals for the purpose of
such discussions.</p>

<p>“If, as a Member of Parliament, any gentleman or committee
should wish to give the Duke information, or the benefit of their
opinion, he is always ready to receive the same in writing, but he
declines to waste their time and his own by asking any gentleman to
come to this distant part of the town to discuss a question upon
which he would decline to deliver his opinion, excepting in his place
in Parliament.</p>

<p>“Moreover the Duke, although not in political office, has much
public business to occupy his time, and on Thursday in particular,
the day named by Mr. Moffatt, he will be occupied by attendance
upon the Naval and Military Commission during the whole of the
forenoon, until the meeting of the House of Parliament of which he
is a member.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Being thus disappointed of an interview, the deputation
requested me to undertake the duty of addressing
the Duke by letter. I wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Bayswater, July 22, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord Duke</span>,—At the request of the Mercantile Committee
on Postage, I have the honour to submit for your Grace’s consideration
a few facts in support of the Bill for the establishment
of a uniform penny postage, which it is expected will shortly be
brought into the House of Lords.</p>

<p>“The evidence which has been given before the Select Committee
on Postage proves that the Post Office revenue has scarcely increased
at all for the last twenty-four years.</p>

<p>“That the present high rates lead all classes, except those allowed
to frank, to evade postage to an enormous extent.</p>

<p>“That they cause a vast amount of correspondence, mercantile as
well as domestic, to be actually suppressed, thus crippling trade and
preventing friendly intercourse.</p>

<p>“That if postage were reduced to one penny the revenue would
be more likely to gain than to suffer.</p>

<p>“That the <i>present</i> average cost to the Post Office of distributing
letters is ¾<i>d.</i> each, and that this cost would be greatly reduced
under the proposed arrangements.</p>

<p>“That the cost to the Post Office is frequently greater for short
distances of six or eight miles than for long distances of two or three
hundred miles; thus showing the unfairness of the present varying
charges.</p>

<p>“And that the partial reductions in postage rates hitherto made
have, after a short time, invariably benefited the revenue.</p>

<p>“I have taken the liberty of enclosing a short abstract of the
Report of the Select Committee on Postage, which has been drawn
up by the Mercantile Committee, as well as some ‘Facts and Estimates
as to the Increase of Letters,’ prepared by myself, to which I
respectfully solicit your Grace’s attention.</p>

<p>“The boldness, yet safety of the proposed change, its simplicity,
and its tendency to extend commerce, science, and education, will,
I confidently hope, recommend it to your Grace’s favourable consideration.</p>

<p class="center">“I have, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>.</p>

<p>“To His Grace the <span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>To this letter I received no reply, nor was any
expected; but the letter appears to have had its effect,
for when the debate came on, the Duke, as will be
seen hereafter, distinctly supported the measure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bill for establishing penny postage
was brought in by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Lord John Russell, and Mr. F. Baring; and passed
the first reading without discussion.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>The second reading took place on the 22nd July,
after a debate in which Mr. Goulbourn, Sir Robert
Inglis, and Sir Robert Peel attacked, and Mr. Francis
Baring, Lord Seymour, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr. Wallace, and Mr. Warburton defended the
bill. The attack was founded chiefly on the large
powers granted to the Treasury, though Sir R. Peel,
while admitting “that a great reduction of postage
might be made, not only without injury, but with great
advantage to the revenue,” thought, however, “that
it would be better to make a partial reduction of the
postage duties than to repeal them almost entirely, as
is now proposed,” and considered “that the advantages
to be derived from such a proposition are much over-rated.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Sir Robert Inglis also objected to the
abolition of the Parliamentary privilege of franking,
stating incidentally that to some mercantile houses it
was worth £300 a year; but his objection was over-ruled
by Sir Robert Peel, who strongly urged the
importance of abolishing the privilege in question,
adding that, if each Government department were
required to pay its own postage, much would be
done towards checking abuse. He also advised
that “Parliamentary Proceedings” should be subjected
to a moderate postage charge; and it is scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
necessary to add that Sir Robert Peel’s advice on
this point was followed.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The bill was read without
a division.</p>

<p>On the following day the public anxiety relative
to the House of Lords showed itself in a petition
“signed by the Mayor and upwards of twelve thousand
five hundred of the merchants of the city of
London, which the Noble Lord who presented the
petition understood had been signed in twelve hours,”
praying that no temporary deficiency of revenue might
delay the establishment of penny postage.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> As this,
though not by any means the last petition presented,
is the last requiring notice, it may not be
amiss to mention here that the number of petitions
presented to Parliament in favour of penny postage
during the single session of 1839 was upwards of two
thousand, the number of appended signatures being
about a quarter of a million; while as many of the
petitions proceeded from Town Councils, Chambers
of Commerce, and other such Corporations, a single
signature in many instances represented a considerable
number of persons.</p>

<p>On July the 29th the bill was read a third time and
passed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announcing,
in reply to Sir Robert Peel, that Government had not
yet determined on the precise mode in which the
measure should be introduced.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Before following the bill to the Upper House I will
mention a circumstance which, however trifling in
itself, may derive some interest from its connection
with a body so much the “observed of all observers”
as the House of Commons. One night, when a
discussion on Post Office affairs was to come on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
I was sitting under the gallery, when one of the
members suggested to me that I should go upstairs
and get some refreshment; a hint of which, after
some hesitation as to the propriety of intruding,
I gladly availed myself. Following the directions I
received, I went to the “Kitchen,” where the cooks
were hard at work. Upon my request for tea a
wooden tea-tray was handed to me. As I half suspected
that I was thus made to wait upon myself
because I was looked upon as an intruder, I watched
the motions of such as came by unquestionable right.
Scarcely had I taken my seat when I saw Joseph
Hume doing as I had done; others followed in like
manner, and I soon became aware that this was the
common practice. Whether any change has been
made I know not, but I was glad to remark that the
members of an assembly accounted one of the most
fastidious in the world were not ashamed to wait upon
themselves.</p>

<p>A few days later I received a letter from Lord
Duncannon, informing me that Lord Melbourne
wished to see me at one o’clock on the following
Sunday. On calling, I found only Lord Duncannon
in the drawing-room, who informed me that the Premier
was not yet up, though, as he had been assured by
the servants, he might soon be expected. I must
mention, by the way, that Lord Duncannon, who
always, I believe, save in his official capacity, had been
friendly to my plan, had now taken it up with a
certain degree of warmth, having in his place in
Parliament declared himself persuaded, “that, with
great exertion on the part of those who are to
carry the bill into execution, there will ultimately
not be any loss,” and added, “that he never
recollected so strong a wish having been expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
to both Houses of Parliament on any measure as
had been expressed on the subject of postage.”<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>After a little time Lord Melbourne made his
appearance, in his dressing-gown. My reception
was most kindly, and we presently went to work.
In the course of conversation I had occasion to speak
of Mr. Warburton, when Lord Melbourne interrupted
me with, “Warburton! Warburton! He’s one of
your moral-force men, isn’t he?” I replied that I
certainly believed Mr. Warburton’s hopes of improvement
did rest more on moral than on physical force.
“Well,” he rejoined, “I can understand your physical-force
men, but as to your moral-force men, I’ll be
damned if I know what they mean.” Not hitting
upon any apposite reply, I remained silent, and a
second time we returned to the subject of the interview,
until at length, seeming to have become
possessed of his subject, he began to pace the room,
as if arranging his speech; often moving his lips,
though uttering no audible sound. In this process,
however, he was interrupted by the entrance of a
servant, who made an announcement which did not
reach my ear. The answer was, “Show him into the
other room,” and, after a short time, Lord Melbourne,
apologising for leaving us, withdrew. A minute afterwards,
the hum of conversation sounded through the
folding-doors, and, by-and-by, one of the voices
gradually rose in distinctness and earnestness, taking
at length an angry tone, in which I presently heard
my own name pronounced. As the voice seemed to
me that of a stranger, I must have turned an inquiring
eye towards Lord Duncannon, who informed me that
it was that of Lord Lichfield. After a while, warmth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
seemed to abate, the tone became moderate, and at
length the farewell was given, Lord Melbourne, re-entering
by the folding-doors, with the remark,
“Lichfield has been here; I can’t think why a man
can’t talk of penny postage without going into a
passion.”</p>

<p>Next day, August 5th, Lord Melbourne proposed,
in a long speech, the second reading of the Postage
Bill. He fully admitted that the income of the country
fell short of the expenditure—allowed that there was
great uncertainty as to the fiscal results of penny
postage; but intimated that a surplus or deficiency
of three or four hundred thousand pounds in an income
of forty-eight millions was a matter of comparatively
little moment, and justified the course Government had
taken mainly on the ground of “the very general
feeling and general concurrence of all parties in favour
of the plan.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, after stating various
objections to the measure, especially on the score of
depression in the finances, yet recognising the evils
of high postage rates, and expressing an opinion “that
that which was called Mr. Rowland Hill’s plan was,
if it was adopted exactly as proposed, of all plans that
most likely to be successful,” concluded with saying, “I
shall, although with great reluctance, vote for the bill,
and I earnestly recommend you to do likewise.”</p>

<p>The Earl of Lichfield was anxious to remove the
impression that he was opposed to the measure, and
“to show that, with perfect consistency with all that he
had said or done, he could give a vote for the proposal
of his noble friend at the head of the Government.”
He supported the plan, however, “on entirely different
grounds from those on which Mr. Hill proposed it,”
viz., in relation to the universal demand for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
measure, and on the understanding that it was not
expected “that by the measure either the revenue
would be a gainer or that under it the revenue would
be equal to that now derived from the Post Office
department.”<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>The bill was read a second time, without a division.</p>

<p>In accordance with Lord Melbourne’s request I was
present during the discussion; as it proceeded there
was much anxiety as to the result, but, above all,
speculation was busy as to the course that would be
taken by the Duke of Wellington. I remember, however,
that in the outset I myself felt rather confident
on this latter point, having received assurance, as I
think, from Lord Duncannon; but when in the course
of the discussion the Duke dwelt on the low state of
the national finances, and the danger of reducing a
duty under such circumstances, I began to fear that
I had been misinformed. I suppose this feeling must
have been expressed by my looks, for Lord Duncannon,
leaving his seat, kindly came to where I sat,
on the steps of the throne, and whispered, “Don’t
be alarmed, he’s not going to oppose us.” Thus
reassured I listened calmly, and, as the Duke proceeded,
perceived distinctly that my fears were
groundless.</p>

<p>The third reading took place four days later without
even a debate. The bill received the Royal assent
on the 17th. I must not omit to mention that on the
Royal assent being given, Mr. Wallace, with his usual
kindness, wrote to my wife, to congratulate her on the
success of her husband’s efforts, a success to which
her unremitting exertions had greatly contributed.</p>

<p>Thus, in little more than three years from the time
when I entered seriously upon my investigations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in little more than two years and a-half from my first
application to Government, this measure, so bold in its
innovation and paradoxical in its policy as to be met
in the outset with the ridicule and scorn of those to
whom the public naturally looked as best qualified
by position to judge of its value, had become law.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>And now again came a period of comparative rest,
though my thoughts frequently reverted to the recommendations
kindly made by Mr. Warburton and Mr.
Wallace, with no small anxiety about my future relations
to the reform now resolved upon. Friends on
all hands assured me that, as Government had taken
my plan, it must also take me; but to my mind the
consequence did not appear certain; and even supposing
it sure that Government would take me, it yet
remained to be inquired what the Government would do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
with me. Many were the suggestions that were made.
The following may be taken as a specimen. One of
my brothers meeting Lord King, the following conversation
took place. “Well, what are Government going
to do with your brother Rowland?” “Nay, my Lord,
I do not know that they are going to do anything with
him.” “Oh, they must give him something, no doubt
of that; the only question is what. Now this is what
they clearly ought to do. They should tell Colonel
Maberly that he has fought his battle well, stood to his
guns to the last, but has been defeated; and that being
the case, must, of course, withdraw and make way for
his successful rival.”</p>

<p>While I thus kept an eye on everything that might
give indication as to my future, I received the following
letter from Lord Ashburton, who had been the first
amongst men high in influence and position to take
an active part in the promotion of my plan. It will
be remarked that his Lordship, owing doubtless to
his long experience in financial affairs, was more
correct than I in his estimate of immediate results;
but it must be remembered that penny postage was
left for years without those supports which formed
an essential part of my plan, and which had been
so pointedly urged by the Duke of Wellington as
necessary to its results:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“The Grange, Alresford, August 20, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I most unfeignedly congratulate you that your great
measure is so far safely landed. You do too much honour to the part I
have humbly taken in this matter. I have certainly been unfeignedly
anxious that this important experiment should be tried, and tried fairly;
but the merit is undividedly yours, and the success due to the unexampled
perseverance and intelligence you have applied to opening
and instructing the public mind. What Parliament can do is done,
and it only remains to be hoped that success will not be hazarded by
imperfect execution. What measures the Post Office will adopt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
I cannot know, but I think they will make a great mistake if they
do not contrive to secure your assistance.</p>

<p>“If it should really turn out that your anticipations as to maintaining
the revenue are realised, your triumph will be great indeed:
one half of it will be more than I expect; but on this point there
must, after all, be much speculative uncertainty, and my only regret
was that our finances were not in a better state to make useful
experiments. I shall watch the result with great interest, and beg
you will believe me,</p>

<p>“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Ashburton</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq.</p>

<p>“I hope the principle of prepayment will be stoutly maintained.
Any relaxation must be very temporary and with a large additional
charge. Without this the scheme will not work. The plan of
postage-stamps seems to my mind the best. The post-officers should
sell them, and as everybody must put his letter into some office, he
may there also buy his stamp.”</p>

</div>

<p>About a fortnight later, I was summoned to take my
part in a very gratifying proceeding at Wolverhampton,
where a subscription had been raised to present me
with a handsome silver candelabrum, which bore the
following inscription:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq., presented by the inhabitants of
Wolverhampton, in testimony of their high sense of his public
services, as the Founder and able Advocate of the Plan of Universal
Penny Postage, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1839.”</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">APPOINTMENT IN TREASURY. (1839.)</span></h3>

<p>Before leaving town for Wolverhampton, as I was
in constant hope of a communication from Government,
I had given strict injunction at the South
Australian Office that if any such communication
arrived it should be forwarded without delay. Now
it so happened that a certain gentleman, well known
to us at the time in connection with Australian affairs,
had bestowed on our proceedings more attention than
was either profitable or convenient, and had begun to
be regarded much in the light in which, doubtless, I
myself was then viewed at the Post Office; in short,
he had been unanimously voted an intolerable bore.
When, therefore, a packet arrived at the office with
what appeared to be his name written in the left-hand
corner of the direction, it was naturally treated
as a missive which might very conveniently await
my return; and it was not until a messenger came
from the Treasury to inquire why no notice had been
taken of a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
that the clerk on duty became aware of the mistake.
Hastening to correct the blunder, well aware of the
Post Office delay, and impressed with the novel speed
of railway conveyance, he instantly made up the
despatch in a brown paper parcel, which he sent, with
all speed, to the station, but which, by the tardiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
its conveyance, practically demonstrated that even
postal dilatoriness might be outdone.</p>

<p>The packet came into my hands just before the
ceremony of presentation began, and, being eagerly
opened, was found to contain a summons to Downing
Street; a fact contributing, as may be supposed, not a
little to the pleasure of the day.</p>

<p>On presenting myself at the Treasury I was very
courteously received by the new Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Francis Baring (Mr.
Spring Rice having been just raised to the peerage).
Before speaking of what occurred, I wish to premise
that I afterwards found in Mr. Baring a steady friend
and zealous supporter, his kind interest in my plan and
myself never failing until death.</p>

<p>This first interview, however, was on one important
point very unsatisfactory. To make this clear, it must
be recollected that I then held a permanent office,
involving heavy duties and implying great trust and
responsibility, and that though my salary was as yet
only £500 a-year (all salaries in this new department
being then low), yet as I had been fortunate enough
to give full satisfaction, I had every prospect of increase,
and a fair chance of promotion. When, therefore, it
was proposed that I should abandon this position to
accept an engagement for two years only, without any
increase of salary, I must confess I could scarcely avoid
regarding the offer as an affront. I was yet more
struck with the disadvantage to which the degradation
(for such it was) which I was to suffer would place me
in respect of ability to carry out my plans; nor did
I try to conceal my feelings. However I brought the
conference to a close by informing Mr. Baring that
I must consult my friends upon his offer; and that,
as my eldest brother was then at Leicester, I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
it would be three days before I could give my
answer.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the following day, I went to
Leicester, arriving late in the evening. I found
my brother stretched on a sofa; he had had a hard
day’s work, and seemed quite exhausted; so that
although I was aware he must know that important
business alone could have brought me so far, I naturally
proposed to defer everything to the next day. Of
this, however, he would not hear; saying that he had
another day’s hard work before him, so that no time
must be lost. To do the best under the circumstances, I
began my story in as passionless a manner as I could
command; and for a short time he listened quietly
enough, seeming too much oppressed by fatigue to be
capable of strong interest. When, however, I came
to the offer of £500, a sudden change occurred. He
seemed not merely to start but to bound from the sofa,
his face flushing, and his frame quivering with indignation.
When he became somewhat more composed,
and the whole matter had been duly discussed, he
suggested that he should write a letter for me to
hand to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I eagerly
accepted his offer, but he consented—the hour being
by this time over late—to defer the execution of his
task until morning.</p>

<p>At an early hour, we were at work, I writing from
his dictation. When the letter was completed, I
returned to town by the first conveyance, reaching
home in the middle of the night. The following is
my brother’s letter. I need not apologize for its
insertion in full:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Leicester, Sept. 12, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Rowland</span>,—Before I give you my opinion, I think it better
to prevent the possibility of misapprehension, by putting in writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the heads of what you have reported to me as having occurred at
the interview between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and yourself
on Tuesday, respecting your proposed employment by the Government
in carrying your plan of Post Office reform into operation.</p>

<p>“You state that Mr. Baring, having regard to what had been
arranged between Lord Monteagle and himself, offered to engage
your services for two years for the sum of £500 per annum; you,
for that remuneration, undertaking to give up your whole time to the
public service. That on your expressing surprise and dissatisfaction
at this proposal, the offer was raised to £800, and subsequently to
£1,000 per annum. You state that your answer to these proposals
was, in substance, that you were quite willing to give your services
gratuitously, or to postpone the question of remuneration until the
experiment shall be tried; but that you could not consent to enter
upon such an undertaking on a footing in any way inferior to that of
the Secretary to the Post Office. You explained, you say, the object
which you had in view in making this stipulation—you felt that
it was a necessary stipulation to insure you full power to carry the
measure into effect.</p>

<p>“I have carefully considered the whole matter in all its bearings,
and I cannot raise in my mind a doubt of the propriety of your
abiding by these terms; and I will set down, as shortly as I can, the
reasons which have occurred to me to show that the course you have
taken was the only one really open to you.</p>

<p>“It is quite clear that to insure a fair trial for your plan you will
require great powers; that Ministers will not interfere with you
themselves, nor, as far as they can prevent it, suffer you to be
thwarted by others, I can readily believe; but I am not so sure
of their power as I am of their goodwill. You have excited great
hostility at the Post Office—that we know as a matter of fact; but
it must have been inferred if the fact had not been known. It is
not in human nature that the gentlemen of the Post Office should
view your plan with friendly eyes. If they are good-natured persons,
as I dare say they are, they will forgive you in time; but they have
much to overlook. That a stranger should attempt to understand
the arcana of our system of postage better than those whose duty it
was to attain to such knowledge, was bad enough; that he should
succeed, was still worse; but that he should persuade the country
and the Parliament that he had succeeded is an offence very difficult
to pardon. Now, you are called upon to undertake the task of
carrying into action, through the agency of these gentlemen, what
they have pronounced preposterous, wild, visionary, absurd, clumsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and impracticable. They have thus pledged themselves, by a
distinct prophecy, repeated over and over again, that the plan
cannot succeed. I confess I hold in great awe prophets who may
have the means of assisting in the fulfilment of their own predictions.
Believe me, you will require every aid which Government, backed by
the country, can give you to conquer these difficulties. You found
it no easy task to defeat your opponents in the great struggle which
is just concluded; but what was that to what you are now called
upon to effect? no less an enterprise than to change your bitter
enemies into hearty allies, pursuing your projects with goodwill,
crushing difficulties instead of raising them, and using their practical
knowledge, not to repel your suggestions and to embarrass your
arrangements, but using that same knowledge in your behalf, aiding
and assisting in those matters wherein long experience gives them
such a great advantage over you, and which may be turned for or
against you at the pleasure of the possessors.</p>

<p>“To try this great experiment, therefore, with a fair chance of
success, it must be quite clear that you have the confidence of the
Government; and that can only be shown by their advancing you to
an equality, at least, with the principal executive officer among those
with whose habits and prejudices you must of necessity so much and
so perpetually interfere. Have you made Mr. Baring sufficiently
aware of the numerous—I might say numberless—innovations,
which your plan of necessity implies? The reduction of postage
and the modes of prepayment are, no doubt, the principal features
of your plan; but you lay great stress, and very properly, in my
opinion, on increasing the facilities for transmitting letters; and this
part of the reform will, I apprehend, cause you more labour of
detail than that which more strikes the public eye. In this department
you will be left to contend with the Post Office almost alone.
It will be very easy to raise plausible objections to your measures,
of which Ministers can hardly be supposed to be competent judges,
either in respect of technical information or of leisure for inquiry.
Neither would the public, even if you had the means and inclination
to appeal to it, give you assistance in matters upon which you could
never fix its attention.</p>

<p>“But your personal weight and importance as compared with that
of others who it is reasonable to believe will, in the first instance at
least, be opposed to you, will be measured very much by comparison
of salary. We may say what we will, but Englishmen are neither
aristocratic nor democratic, but chrysocratic (to coin a word). Your
salary will, therefore, if you have one at all, fix your position in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
minds of every functionary of the Post Office, from the Postmaster-General
to the bellman, both inclusive.</p>

<p>“But though I see these insuperable objections to your accepting
either of the salaries which have been offered, I will not advise you
(and you would reject such advice if I gave it) to embarrass the
Government, if there be any difficulty, which there may be unknown
to us, in the way of their either giving you a higher salary, or
postponing the question of remuneration until the end of the two
years. Your offer made on the spur of the moment, to surrender
your present appointment, and work for the public without salary,
though it does look somewhat ‘wild and visionary’ at first sight, yet
after a long and careful reflection upon it, I distinctly advise you to
renew, and more than that, I seriously hope it will be accepted.
Your fortune, though most men would consider it very small, is
enough to enable you to live two years without additional income;
and I feel certain that the Government and the country will do you
and your family justice in the end; but suppose I should be mistaken,
and that you never receive a shilling for either your plan or
your services in carrying it into operation, I should be very glad
to change places with you, and so would thousands of your countrymen,
if, on taking your labours and privations, they could also feel
conscious of your merit.</p>

<p class="center">“I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">M. D. Hill</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter I forwarded the next day, enclosing it
in a short one from myself to the same effect; in
which also I proposed to wait upon Mr. Baring at four
o’clock, to give him any further explanation.</p>

<p>I was received in a manner not merely courteous
but most friendly; no time was lost in debate, and I
was requested to call again the following day at one
o’clock, to see the draft of a letter which Mr. Baring
undertook to prepare meanwhile. Of this letter,
which, upon my expressing satisfaction with it, Mr.
Baring immediately signed and handed to me, the
following is a copy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Downing Street, September 14, 1839.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I write you the result of our interviews, feeling that it
may be a satisfaction to you to possess some memorandum on
paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>“With respect to the position in which you would be placed,
I would explain that you will be attached to the Treasury, and
considered as connected with that department with reference to
the proposed alterations in the Post Office. You will have access
to the Post Office, and every facility given you of inquiry both
previously to the arrangements being settled and during their
working. Your communications will be to the Treasury, from
whom any directions to the Post Office will be issued; and you
will not exercise any direct authority, or give any immediate orders
to the officers of the Post Office. I make this explanation as to the
mode of doing our business, to prevent future misunderstanding.
Your communications and suggestions, &amp;c., will be with the Treasury,
in whom I consider the power to superintend and carry into effect
these alterations to be vested.</p>

<p>“With respect to the money arrangements, I understand the employment
to be secured for two years certain, at the rate of £1,500
per annum. I should also add that the employment is considered
as temporary, and not to give a <i>claim</i> to continued employment in
office at the termination of these two years.</p>

<p>“Having put duly upon paper a memorandum of our conversation,
I cannot conclude without expressing my satisfaction that the
Treasury are to have the benefit of your assistance in the labour
which the legislature has imposed upon us, and my conviction that
you will find from myself and the Board that confidence and
cordiality which will be necessary for the well working of the proposed
alterations.</p>

<p class="center">“I am, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">F. T. Baring</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course I inwardly objected to that clause in the
letter which limited my absolute engagement to two
years, but I reckoned upon making myself within that
period so useful as to secure a permanent appointment.
Mr. Baring having referred to the arrangement which
placed me, not at the Post Office, but at the Treasury,
I replied that of course he might put me then where he
liked, but that I should end by being Secretary to the
Post Office—a prediction in the end fulfilled, though
certainly by no means so speedily as I expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was soon followed by a Treasury Minute,
making the formal appointment. On carefully reconsidering
both, I thought that my powers were neither
so considerable nor so clearly set forth as could be
desired; nevertheless two days later, viz., on Monday,
September 16th, 1839, I entered on the duties of my
new office, rejoicing in the belief that I was at length
in a position to effect the great reform I had originated,
feeling, also, at the moment, well rewarded for all past
labours and anxieties, and, though not blind to future
difficulties, yet too well pleased with my success thus
far to allow any painful anticipations much place in my
thoughts.</p>

<p>From what has already been stated, the reader must
be aware that, however deep the gratification with
which, at the end of three years’ unceasing effort, I
at length found myself in a recognised position, in
direct communication with persons of high authority,
and intrusted with powers which, however weak and
limited in the outset, seemed, if discreetly used, not
unlikely in due time to acquire strength and durability,
I was far from supposing that the attainment of my
post was the attainment of my object. The obstacles,
numerous and formidable, which had been indicated
in my brother’s letter, had all, I felt, a real existence;
while others were sure to appear, of which, as yet,
I knew little or nothing. Still I felt no way daunted,
but relying at once on the efficiency of my plan, and
on the promised support of Government, I felt confident
of succeeding in the end.</p>

<p>On the very day that I took my place in Downing
Street I accompanied the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to the Post Office, in order to inspect the practical
working of the department, which, as already mentioned,
I had never had an opportunity of witnessing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
My first impressions contradicted in some measure
my expectations; the whole process of dealing with
the letters I found more rapid than I had supposed.
Here, however, was a fallacy very naturally produced,
and which has doubtless imposed upon many an
unpractised visitor. The presence of strangers
naturally puts every man on his mettle; and efforts
are made which could not be long sustained. Again,
the head of a department, zealous for its reputation,
directs observation, unconsciously perhaps, to his best
men; while the unwary spectator, generalizing on both
points, attributes to every pair of hands and to the
whole period of manipulation a speed which rightly
pertains only to a few individuals, and even in their
case to a very brief time. Another source of misconception
I found to lurk in the many errors made
in the haste of action; whereby a large number of
letters came back to the hands which had passed them,
and being viewed by the observer as new letters
failed, of course, to produce any abatement in his
estimate of speed.</p>

<p>I found the “taxation of letters” more rapid, and
the sorting slower, than I had reckoned upon; but
soon perceived that the sorting was greatly impeded
by want of room, which was indeed bitterly complained
of by those concerned. This lack of space
was the more remarkable, since the building, which
had been erected at enormous expense, was as yet
only ten years old, and had witnessed but little increase
of business within its walls.</p>

<p>The rooms indeed were lofty, even to the full height
of the edifice, but yet ill ventilated; reminding one of
what has been said by I forget whom, that, if the
crowd be but dense enough, a man may be stifled
even where his ceiling is the sky. A thermometer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the room marked 72°, but I was informed it sometimes
rose to 90°; so that between heat and impurity
of the air the men’s working powers must have been
seriously impaired; to say nothing of more lasting
injury to their health. Some of the officers in
attendance suggested the construction of galleries,
which, without lessening the general height of the
room, might afford more space; but knowing that
mere height, as indeed shown by the actual state of
things, is but a secondary consideration, and observing
that there was considerable space between the ceiling
and the roof, I recommended that the room should be
divided into two floors, the ceiling being raised, and
that for the removal of bags, recourse should be had to
lifts, such as I had seen in use in the cotton mills
at Belper and elsewhere. Both these suggestions were
in the end adopted.</p>

<p>As this inspection had the disadvantage of being
foreknown, I determined that my next should be made
without notice; and accordingly somewhat surprised
my friends at the Office by appearing amongst them
soon after six the next morning. I did not perceive,
however, any noticeable difference in the state of
things, save that, the work being less, and the hands
therefore fewer, there was a corresponding decrease
of bustle and closeness.</p>

<p>I suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
that, as room at the Post Office was already deficient,
and was likely to be more so when the lower rate was
adopted, no time should be lost in establishing the
district offices and uniting the two corps of letter-carriers,
as I had recommended. By his request I
drew up a paper giving my views in detail. To
dispose of this matter for the present, I must say
that I did not then succeed in convincing him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
soundness of my views, and that, in fact, they were not
acted upon until fifteen years later.</p>

<p>I may mention here, that my Journal, after a long
suspension, was now resumed; and it is by reference
to this that I am able to give details which have long
ago passed from my memory. I find that my practice
was still to rise at six, and to proceed straightway to
work at my official duties; indeed, when I was at the
Treasury, my attention was so much diverted to questions
of detail on postal matters of all kinds that, had
I confined my work to office hours, though I made
these unusually long, the progress of reform, slow as it
actually was, would have been reduced to a veritable
snail’s pace. My long hours, however, soon obliged
me to apply for additional assistance.</p>

<p>From this Journal I proceed to give one or two
extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>1839, September 20th.</i>—Mr. Baring came to me at the Treasury.
[He] had not been able to look over the <i>agenda</i>, though
at work till four this morning. Will take it next, and let
me know when ready to discuss it. Asked me to state what
assistance I thought necessary. I replied that I wished to
engage the services of Cole (whom I had mentioned on a
previous day), and that I required a clerk or amanuensis....
As to a clerk, B. recommended that I should select one
from the Post Office, as his practical knowledge would be useful to
me. To this I assented, and it was arranged that B. should write
to Colonel Maberly on the subject, but it afterwards occurred
to me that the arrangement might possibly lead to unpleasant
consequences. I therefore went to Mr. Baring and represented
this view of the subject, at the same time proposing that I should
engage Mr. Ledingham.... To this B. consented. I proposed
a salary of 40<i>s.</i> per week, but B. objected to more than 30<i>s.</i>,
such being the allowance to supernumerary clerks in the Customs.
The salary was therefore fixed at this sum.”</p>

</div>

<p>The engagement of Mr. Cole, applied for as above,
was completed three days later; and thus I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
great satisfaction of retaining after my appointment
aid which had been so highly serviceable before.
Mr. Ledingham, also, was engaged, and fully justified
Mr. Gardiner’s recommendation;<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> working with me
through many years, first at the Treasury and afterwards
at the Post Office, up to the commencement of
his fatal illness, with intelligence, fidelity, and zeal.</p>

<p>About this time I began to experience somewhat of
that kind of annoyance which my own proceedings
during the last two years and a-half must have produced
to the Post Office authorities, and in some
measure to the Government of the day. I was now
myself, in some sort, within the pale, and I began to
find that through my difference of position there was a
decided change in the sound produced by a knocking
at the outer gate. Suggestions for improvement and
applications on other subjects soon became numerous;
and were sufficient to occupy much time, and to make
me practically understand the nervous irritability produced
in all Government departments by applications
from without.</p>

<p>A day or two later I again visited the Post Office,
and was present at the sorting of letters for the
twopenny post. Here was anything rather than the
pressure which I had observed in the evening sorting
of the General Post letters, the force being evidently
far too great for the work; so that at the rate at
which I <i>saw</i> the letters sorted the average number per
delivery, say six thousand, might have been sorted
completely in the time occupied (about an hour and a
quarter) by four persons; and yet the sorters formed
quite a crowd. Of course I found in this fact additional
reason for that union of the two divisions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
letter-carriers which was an essential preliminary to the
establishment of the district system.</p>

<p>Mr. Baring had expressed a wish that I should visit
the French Post Office, which, he had been informed,
was in some respects very well managed. Not to dwell
too minutely on this inspection, I will only state some
few of the results set forth in my report.</p>

<p>I found that the gross Post Office revenue of France
was about two-thirds that of England; the expenses,
about twenty per cent. more, and the net revenue
somewhat less than one-half.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The rates of postage I found to be about two-thirds
of our rates for corresponding distances, but to vary
for equal distances, not as with us, according to the
number of enclosures, but simply [as I had proposed
for England] according to the weight of the letter or
packet.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>I found a kind of book post in use; the charges,
however, being regulated not by weight, but by superficial
measurement of the paper.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Considering the small extent of Paris as compared
with London, I found the number of Post Offices
much larger, viz., 246 against 237.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>There was another point on which the French Post
Office was—and, it must be admitted, still is—in advance
of ours, viz., that it undertakes the transmission
of valuables of small dimensions at a commission paid
of five per cent. If the article be lost, the Post Office
pays the price at which it was valued.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>An arrangement for transmitting money through
the Post Office was, I found, in great use, or what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
thought such, while our money-order system, owing to
the high rates of charge and other causes had but a
very limited operation; the yearly amount transmitted
being less than half that in France.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there had appeared in the “Quarterly
Review” an elaborate attack, said to have been written
by Mr. Croker, on my whole plan and all its supporters;
the Mercantile Committee, the Parliamentary
Committee, the witnesses, and, above all, the Government,
receiving each a share of the reproaches which
fell primarily upon myself. A few extracts from this
article may still interest or amuse my readers.</p>

<p>It contains one statement of some importance, which,
had I recollected it at the proper time, would have been
useful in a recent discussion as to the origin of postage
stamps:—</p>

<p>“M. Piron tells us that the idea of a post-paid envelope originated
early in the reign of Louis XIV. with M. de Valayer, who, in 1653,
established (with royal approbation) a private penny post, placing
boxes at the corners of the streets for the reception of letters wrapped
up in envelopes, which were to be bought at offices established for
that purpose....</p>

<p>“But this device had long been forgotten even in France; and we
have no doubt that when Mr. Charles Knight, an extensive publisher
as well as an intelligent literary man, proposed, some years since, a
stamped cover for the circulation of newspapers, he was under no
obligation for the idea to Monsieur de Valayer. Mr. Hill, adopting
Mr. Knight’s suggestion, has applied it to the general purposes of
the Post Office with an ingenuity and address which make it his
own.”<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

</div>

<p>My statement that the Post Office revenue had
remained stationary during the twenty years preceding
the writing of my pamphlet is pronounced by the
writer to be completely overthrown by the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Post Office revenue had doubled during the fifteen
years preceding that period.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Expectation of moral benefits from low postage is
thus met:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the whole we feel that, so far from the <i>exclusive</i> benefits to
‘<i>order</i>, <i>morals</i>, and <i>religion</i>’ which Mr. Hill and the committee put
forward, there is, at least, as great a chance of the contrary mischief,
and that the proposed penny post might perhaps be more justly
characterised as ‘<i>sedition made easy</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The reader of the present day, whom dire necessity
has accustomed to modern hardships, will be roused to
a sense of his condition by learning that “prepayment
by means of a stamp or stamped cover is universally
admitted to be quite the reverse of convenient, foreign
to the habits of the people,”<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>The attack was answered in the next number of the
“Edinburgh Review” in an article written by my
eldest brother, which thus concludes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let, then, any temporary diminution of income be regarded as an
outlay. It would be but slight considered with reference to the
objects in view, and yet all that is demanded for the mightiest social
improvement ever attempted at a single effort. Suppose even an
average yearly loss of a million for ten years. It is but half what the
country has paid for the abolition of slavery, without the possibility of
any <i>money</i> return. Treat the deficit as an outlay of capital, and
those who make a serious affair of it suppose that a great nation is to
shrink from a financial operation which a joint-stock company would
laugh at. But enough of revenue. Even if the hope of ultimate
profit should altogether fail, let us recur to a substituted tax; and if
we are asked, What tax? we shall answer, Any tax you please—certain
that none can operate so fatally on all other sources of revenue as
this. Letters are the <i>primordia rerum</i> of the commercial world. To
tax them at all, is condemned by those who are best acquainted with
the operations of finances. Surely, then, cent. per cent. will hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
be deemed too slight a burden, and yet that—nay, more than that—the
new plan will yield.</p>

<p>“But the country will never consent to adjudge this great cause on
points of revenue. That the Post Office ought to be open to all in
practice, as well as in theory, is now felt to be as necessary to our
progress in true civilisation as the liberty of the press, the representation
of the people in Parliament, public education, sound law
reform, the freedom of commerce, and whatever else we require to
maintain our ‘high prerogative of teaching the nations how to
live.’”</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">PENNY POSTAGE. (1839-40.)</span></h3>

<p>My attention, on my return from France (in October
of this year), was mainly directed to the means of introducing
the system of penny postage as promptly as
was consistent with safety, much care being obviously
necessary to put the office in order for the expected
flood of letters before the sluices were opened. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that in the
outset stamped letters should not be admitted later
than 3 p.m.; the time to be extended when practicable.
The heads of the two chief departments in the Circulation
Office urged, as a preliminary, the erection of
the galleries already spoken of; a measure to which I
objected, both because of the time that it would take,
and because I thought a large outlay at the chief office
(the estimate, without including any arrangement for
better ventilation, being as high as £8,000) would
delay the establishment of those district offices on
which I relied so much both for public convenience
and for the maintenance of the revenue. As a temporary
expedient, I suggested the use of a part of the
Bull and Mouth Inn, which happened then to be
vacant; a suggestion which, unluckily, found no favour
at the Post Office; so that, as the Chancellor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Exchequer could not make up his mind to adopt the
district system, immediate alterations were resolved
upon, at the reduced cost, however, of £6,000.</p>

<p>One cause of delay was found in an invitation issued
by the Treasury, accompanied with the offer of reward,
for plans of collecting the postage, whether by stamps
or otherwise; a proceeding which precluded any positive
action until all the plans, which poured in from
various quarters, should have been duly examined.
The communications were more than two thousand
five hundred in number, and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who had intended to read all himself, was
obliged to delegate the task to the Junior Lords of the
Treasury, who must have had dry work of it, as I
better knew when a considerable portion of the work
devolved ultimately upon myself. Foreseeing much
delay, I suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
the expediency of allowing, in the first instance, prepayment
by money, though, as I pointed out, this
course might increase the difficulty of introducing the
stamp.</p>

<p>A few days later, viz., on November the 2nd, I laid
before the Chancellor of the Exchequer the sketch of
a plan which I had devised for the gradual introduction
of the new system. This was at once to introduce
into the London district the penny rate for prepaid
letters, and to abolish throughout the district the
additional charge of twopence then imposed on every
General Post letter delivered beyond certain limits.
As to the rest of the country, I proposed immediately
to fix fourpence as the maximum single inland rate;
with the abolition of all anomalous charges, such as a
penny for crossing the Menai Bridge, the halfpenny
for crossing the Scottish border, and the penny for
delivery beyond certain limits. These recommendations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
after having been fully considered by the Post
Office and the Treasury, were carried into effect on
the 5th December.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed doubts
as to both the economy and the safety of prepayment;
and though he admitted that stamps must be tried, and
though I submitted an elaborate Report on the whole
subject, his doubts grew yet stronger; but as I remained
confident, he gave way, only declaring that he
threw the responsibility of that part of the measure
entirely upon me. Even had I felt any misgiving, it
was now too late to draw back; but I accepted the
responsibility with alacrity.</p>

<p>Amidst these proceedings there were one or two
occurrences of some interest.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Mr. Cobden, from which I
give an extract, showing that, however favourably I
may have thought of my plan, his expectations far
outran my own:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am prepared to see all the world sorely puzzled and surprised,
to find that the revenue from the penny postage <i>exceeds</i> the first year
any former income of the Post Office.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer consulted me as
to the policy of taking advantage of the willingness, as
reported by Dr. Bowring, of the State of Hamburg to
reduce the charge on English transit letters from fourpence
to a penny in consideration of their letters being
charged a penny for passing through England. I
strongly advised that the treaty should be concluded
forthwith, which was accordingly done.</p>

<p>When, however, I was consulted as to the policy of
further reducing the inland rate on foreign letters
generally, before negotiating similar reductions with
foreign powers, I advised against that course, as likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
to render such negotiations more difficult; and the
project was abandoned.</p>

<p>The question of probable forgery of the stamp still
causing much anxiety, various conferences were held
on the subject. Not to go into tedious details, it may
be mentioned that the three kinds of stamps now in
use, though in very different degree, viz., stamped
letter-paper, stamped envelopes, and adhesive stamps,
were agreed upon, and obtained the approval of the
Treasury.</p>

<p>In the minute establishing the fourpenny rate, care
had been taken to show that the measure was only
temporary, and merely intended to give needful practice
in the new mode of charge, viz., by weight, before
the great expected increase in the number of letters
should occur. The explanation, however, did not give
universal satisfaction, and I began now practically to
feel how great an advantage had been neglected when
Government declined to take up postal reform without
awaiting the coercion of popular demand. The spontaneous
reduction of the existing high rates to a
<i>maximum</i> of even sixpence or eightpence, would have
been welcomed with joy and gratitude; now so low a
maximum as fourpence, though this was the lowest of
all General Post rates when my pamphlet was published,
was received with no small amount of dissatisfaction.
Suspicions arose that the concession would go no
further; Government was accused of an intention to
cheat the public; and I, too, had a share in the accusation,
being charged in some of the newspapers with
having betrayed my own cause. Hitherto denunciations
had fallen on me from above; my elevation
to office now gave opportunity—speedily seized on—for
attacks from below. I had learnt, however, before
this time that all this was to be expected and endured;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
that the only chance of escaping obloquy is to avoid
prominence; that the thin-skinned should keep within
the pale of private life.</p>

<p>December the 5th, the day appointed for the first
change, was of course passed in considerable anxiety
as to the result, but of necessity I had to await the
next morning for the satisfaction of my curiosity. The
following is from my Journal, December 6th:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There was an increase of about fifty per cent. in the number of
letters despatched from London on Thursday as compared with the
previous Thursday, and a loss of about £500 out of £1,600 in the
total charges. The number of paid letters in the district post has
increased from less than 9,000 to about 23,000; the number of unpaid
letters remaining about the same as before, viz., 32,000. No
doubt the increase is greater at present than it will be in a day or
two, as comparatively few letters were written the day before the
reduction; still the result is as yet satisfactory. The Chancellor of
the Exchequer thinks very much so.</p>

<p>“<i>December 7th.</i>—As I expected, the number of letters yesterday
was less than on Thursday; the increase as compared with the previous
Friday being about twenty-five per cent. only.”</p>

</div>

<p>When it was found that the immediate increase was
so very moderate, the moment had arrived for exultation
in those who had predicted failure; and, like Sir
Fretful Plagiary, I was fortunate enough to have more
than one “damned good-natured friend” to keep me
sufficiently informed of the jubilation.</p>

<p>Whilst, as I have said, angry voices arose at the
limited extent of the first reduction, there were at
least some persons who, being out of the reach of
general information, received the change much as I
had once hoped the whole public would do, viz., as a
great and unexpected boon. A poor Irishman, for
instance, who brought a letter to the Chief Office,
with one shilling and fourpence for the postage, upon
having the shilling returned to him, with the information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
that the fourpence was all that was required,
broke out in acknowledgment to the window-clerk
with a “God bless your honour, and thank you.”</p>

<p>About a week after the change, I had the satisfaction
of hearing from Messrs. Bokenham and Smith,
the two heads of the Circulation Department, as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, December 13th.</i>—Bokenham says they do not put more
than one letter in twenty into the scale, and that a greater saving
than he expected results from uniformity of rate; that the increased
number of letters has required no increase of strength. Smith gives
a similar account (he has two additional men). Both laugh at the
notion of the insecurity in the delivery as resulting from prepayment.”</p>

</div>

<p>Three days later I proposed to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer that the penny rate should come into
operation in three weeks from that day; the prepayment
to be made in money until the stamps, now in
preparation, could be issued; and the abolition of
franking to take place as soon as prepayment should
be made compulsory. Mr. Baring approved generally
of the plan, but preferred to extend the time to a
month, and to abolish franking at once; the former
modification being of little moment, the latter, as may
be inferred from the event, a very judicious change.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards—that we might complete the
necessary arrangements without loss of time—the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, on leaving Downing
Street, took me with him to his house at Lee, where,
after dining, we set to work, and, continuing without
interruption, finished our task about one in the morning.
When I rose to retire, somewhat fatigued with
my long day’s work, I observed, to my surprise, that
my host, opening his Treasury box, began to take out
papers as if for immediate examination. Upon my
expressing surprise, and a hope that he was not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to work more that night, he told me that he should not
sleep till all were dealt with. If I had ever supposed
that Chancellors of the Exchequer led an easy life,
I had abundant opportunity, now and afterwards, for
disabuse.</p>

<p>The 10th January,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> 1840, was determined upon as
the day when penny postage should be established
throughout the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>I proposed that the scale of weight, as applied to
high-priced letters (foreign and colonial), should ascend
throughout by the half-ounce. Mr. Baring was favourable
to this arrangement, but it was abandoned for the
time at the desire of Colonel Maberly, who maintained
that trouble would arise from the minuteness of the
grade; and, in fact, it was not adopted till more than
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the examination of the multitudinous
devices for producing an inimitable stamp having at
length been completed, I was called on to prepare a
minute on the whole subject, preparatory to issuing
orders for the execution of the work. The mode of
proceeding in such cases may surprise the uninitiated
as much as, in the outset, it had surprised me. By
this time, however, I had fallen into the routine.
Accordingly, I put my own views on the matter,
modified by what I had gathered in conversation with
my official superior, into the mouths of “My Lords,”
submitting the draft to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
for his comments, in accordance with which I
altered again and again until he was satisfied; soon
learning that when this point was gained, the consent
of “My Lords” was as prompt and certain as the
facing of a company at the command of the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>Few fictions, I suppose, are more complete than the
minutes purporting to describe the proceedings of the
Treasury Board. There was certainly a large and
handsome room containing a suitable table headed
with a capacious arm-chair, the back bearing a crown,
and the seat prepared, as I was informed, for the
reception of the Sovereign, whose visits, however,
scarcely seemed to be frequent, as the garniture was
in rags. On this table, according to the minutes, the
Chancellor laid such and such papers, making such and
such remarks; sometimes the First Lord of the
Treasury appeared as taking a part, though only on
occasions of some little importance, such, for instance,
as my appointment; then deliberation seemed to follow,
certain conclusions to be arrived at, and corresponding
instructions to be given. This had a goodly appearance
on paper, while the simple fact was that, two or
three Junior Lords being seated for form’s sake, papers
were read over which were to go forth as the resultant
minutes of the said meeting, but which, having all been
prepared beforehand, had received the signature of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, or of one of the Secretaries
of the Treasury, the attending Lords giving their
assent, as a matter of course, without a moment’s
thought or hesitation. Once, indeed, while I was yet
very new, I did venture to go so far as to inquire, in
somewhat hesitating language, whether I was to complete
the minute then in hand before it received the
confirmation of the Board; nor shall I readily forget
the look of perplexity which followed the question.
When my meaning was at length perceived, such
answer was given that the inquiry never had to be
repeated.</p>

<p>With regard, however, to the competing plans
for collecting the postage, though valuable suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
were afforded by several, no one was deemed sufficient
in itself. In the end there were selected, from
the whole number of competitors, four whose suggestions
appeared to evince most ingenuity. The reward
that had been offered was divided amongst them in
equal shares, each receiving £100.</p>

<p>By this minute the plan of prepayment was at
length definitely adopted, as was also the use of
stamps; and this in the three forms which I had
recommended before the Treasury issued their invitation
for suggestions; together with the addition
recommended at the same time, that stamps should
be impressed upon paper of any kind sent to the
Stamp Office by the public. It was also ordered that
the penny rate should be adopted forthwith; the stamps
to be introduced as soon as they could be got ready.
Charge by weight having been previously adopted,
there was now added the rule doubling the charge
on letters not paid for in advance.</p>

<p>The Queen having been graciously pleased (and
here the words were no mere form) to abandon her
privilege of franking, thus submitting her letters to the
same rule as those of her humblest subject, it was determined
that all other such privilege should cease at
the same time. And here it may be observed, that
though the obligation then extended to all Government
offices, viz., to have their letters taxed like those of
private persons, might seem to be only formal, since
their so-called payment of postage was little more than
matter of account between one department and another,
yet, as no department likes to see its postage charge in
excess, it constituted, in effect, to a considerable extent,
a real check.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> At the same time, it was essential for
showing the real earnings of the Post Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>In anticipation of a large influx of letters, it was
ordered that, for a time, the free receipt of letters at
the London offices should cease one hour earlier than
before, with a corresponding arrangement at the
country offices; but that the time for the receipt of
late letters should extend to as late an hour as before.</p>

<p>The warrant for this minute appeared in a supplementary
<i>Gazette</i> the same evening, December 28th;
and this is the last event I have to mention in the
year 1839, the third of the penny postage movement.</p>

<p>A question soon arose as to the hour for posting
<i>newspapers</i>, a subject accidentally omitted in the
minute. Here I may observe that, though I was
constantly striving to anticipate all contingencies, and
that for the most part with success, it would now and
then occur that something escaped observation, and
that, in a minute elaborately framed to meet all cases,
some little flaw would still appear to give trouble.
Often, however, the explanation was that a draft liable
to extraneous modification would sometimes be materially
changed by the substitution of a phrase, which,
without careful comparison with the whole document,
seemed a just equivalent for that which it replaced.
However, as already said, here was certainly an
omission. I had supposed that no change would be
made in respect of newspapers, while Colonel Maberly
considered these as included in the term letters. While
we were discussing the point before the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Colonel Maberly contending that the
restriction would be indispensable, I urging that it
would be very unpopular, we were interrupted by the
Chancellor, who meantime had been opening his
letters, and now suddenly exclaimed, “My Exchequer
Bills are at one per cent. premium; so I don’t care for
a little unpopularity.” And thus the matter ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>All being resolved upon, we did not hold it necessary
to pursue the cautious policy observed on some previous
occasions, but took means to make the coming
change as widely known as practicable. Accordingly,
a form of notification having been agreed upon, I
ordered half-a-million of copies to be printed, and at
the same time inserted a short advertisement in every
newspaper throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>On the day before that appointed for the establishment
of Penny Postage, came information as to the
effect of the fourpenny rate, showing that the numerical
increase in the letters affected by the reduction
was, for England and Wales, 33 per cent.; for Scotland,
51; and for Ireland, 52; the increase on the
whole being 36 per cent.</p>

<p>At length the great day arrived. The following are
the entries in my Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>January 10th.</i>—Penny Postage extended to the whole kingdom
this day!<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> ... The Chancellor of the Exchequer much pleased
with Matthew’s admirable article on postage in the ‘Edinburgh
Review,’ published yesterday.</p>

<p>“I have abstained from going to the Post Office to-night lest I
should embarrass their proceedings. I hear of large numbers of
circulars being sent, and the <i>Globe</i> of to-night says the Post Office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
has been quite besieged by people prepaying their letters.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> I guess
that the number despatched to-night will not be less than 100,000,
or more than three times what it was this day twelvemonths. If less,
I shall be disappointed.</p>

<p>“<i>January 11th.</i>—The number of letters despatched last night
exceeded all expectation. It was 112,000, of which all but 13,000
or 14,000 were prepaid. Great confusion in the hall of the Post
Office, owing to the insufficiency of means for receiving the postage.
The number received this morning from the country was nearly
80,000, part, of course, at the old rate. Mr. Baring is in high
spirits. It cannot be expected, however, that this great number
will be sustained at present.</p>

<p>“<i>January 13th.</i>—As was expected, the number of letters despatched
on Saturday was less than on Friday. It was about 70,000. I did
not expect so great a falling off.”</p>

</div>

<p>I must not omit to mention that I received a large
number of letters—mostly from strangers—but all
dated on this, the opening day, thanking me for the
great boon of Penny Postage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>January 14th.</i>—The number of letters yesterday somewhat increased.
About 90,000 each way. Mr. Baring, on my report that
many persons were unable to get to the windows to post their letters
in time, promised to write to Mr. D. W. Harvey, the superintendent
of police, to direct that the thoroughfares may be kept clear.”</p>

</div>

<p>I learnt that on the first evening of the penny rate,
notwithstanding the crush and inconvenience, three
hearty cheers were given in the great hall for Rowland
Hill, followed by three others for the officers of the
department.</p>

<p>As the arrangements for printing the stamps advanced,
it became apparent that it would be necessary
to appoint some well-qualified person to superintend
the process, manage the machinery, &amp;c. My thoughts
turned to my brother Edwin;<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and my recommendation
being favourably received, and the consequent
inquiries being answered as satisfactorily as I was well
assured they must be, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
informed me, about a fortnight later, that he had made
the appointment. The salary he mentioned was £500
or £600 a-year; but, at my brother’s wish, I informed
him that the smaller sum would be preferred, provided
that the sacrifice might avail to secure him efficient
assistance; an arrangement to which the Chancellor
readily consented.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> This appointment promised no
small relief to me; as hitherto much of the time
urgently demanded for more important business had
been necessarily given to merely mechanical arrangements,
since I could not and did not find in uninterested
persons those zealous efforts and that watchful
care which were essential to combined rapidity and
security.</p>

<p>Much, however, still, and indeed for a long time
afterwards, inevitably devolved upon me, which would
be commonly supposed to be altogether out of my
range. Naturally I was regarded by everybody as
responsible for an innovation made on my advice. It
would be beyond measure tedious to describe or even
enumerate, the efforts and precautions for which I was
called upon to give efficiency to the operation of my
plan, and at the same time secure it against that various
trickery to which innovation necessarily opens the
door. Of course, too, each novelty in proceeding was
admitted with more or less difficulty. Thus, for instance,
though it was obviously desirable that the
paper to be used as covers should, before issuing, be
cut into the proper shape (machine-made envelopes
were not yet thought of), yet that preliminary was objected
to, because of the additional trouble it would
give, not only in cutting, but also in counting. It
really cost me a considerable portion of three several
days, to say nothing of some trial of temper, to carry
the point.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the following month (April)
Mulready’s design, together with the stamps intended
for Post Office use, was formally approved. Of this
design I may remark, that though it brought so much
ridicule<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> on the artist and his employers, yet it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
regarded very favourably, before issuing, by the Royal
Academicians, to whom it was presented when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
assembled in council. Neither is the discrepancy hard
to explain, since that which is really beautiful so often
wearies by endless repetition.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> I will mention here
that the public rejection of the Mulready envelope
was so complete as to necessitate the destruction of
nearly all the vast number prepared for issue. It is
a curious fact that a machine had to be constructed
for the purpose; the attempt to do the work by fire
in close stoves (fear of robbery forbade the use of open
ones) having absolutely failed.</p>

<p>Of course my watch on the number of letters was
unceasing, the result being very variable; sometimes
encouraging, and sometimes so unsatisfactory as to
cause me no small uneasiness; a feeling not much
soothed by information that the plan, as I was informed
in confidence by Mr. Gordon (Secretary to the
Treasury), was already pronounced at the Post Office
a total failure.</p>

<p>On March 12th the first parliamentary return on the
subject was obtained; when it appeared that the increase
in the number of chargeable letters was somewhat
less than two and a quarter-fold. Certainly I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
expected more, and was obliged, in my disappointment,
to fall back on my general confidence in the soundness
of my views, deriving, however, some encouragement
from finding that the average postage, instead of being
only 1¼<i>d.</i>, as I had calculated, proved to be nearly
1½<i>d.</i>; a difference which, however trifling in appearance,
would, when multiplied, as it already had to be, by a
hundred and fifty millions, tell sensibly in the result.
This, also, enabled me to correct my calculation as to
the increase in the number of letters necessary to sustain
the gross revenue; which I now reduced from
five-fold to four and three-quarters-fold; a reduction
fully justified eleven years later by the result.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>A Treasury Minute of April 22nd appointed the
6th of the following month as the day when prepayment
by stamps should begin; the alternative of
prepayment in money being left for the present, so as
to allow time for the public to fall quietly into the new
practice. Mr. Baring, indeed, having but little faith
in the expected preference of the public for stamps,
offered to promote their use by making them the only
means of prepayment; but, independently of my confidence
in their acceptability, I preferred that the two
modes, money and stamps, should contend for public
favour on equal terms.</p>

<p>A difficulty, however, arose here, for which I was
quite unprepared, and which may still excite wonder.
Objection was raised in the department to the sale of
stamps at the three Chief Offices, viz., of London,
Dublin, and Edinburgh. I can only suppose that
official dignity was touched, the feeling excited being
such as might arise on board a man-of-war at a
proposal to intrude bales of merchandise on “Her
Majesty’s Quarter-deck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The issue of stamps, however, began, as appointed,
on the 1st of May. Great, I had the satisfaction of
hearing, was the bustle at the Stamp Office; the sale
on this one day amounting to £2,500. It was clear,
therefore, that this practice, so “inconvenient and
foreign to the habits of Englishmen,” was at least to
have trial. So far all was well; but now began a
series of troubles, against which I had striven to
provide, but necessarily through the instrumentality of
others little interested in their prevention.</p>

<p>Six days later, I received information that no stamps
had been issued to any of the receiving-houses in
London. On inquiring into the cause of this omission,
I found that in the Treasury letter, giving instructions
on the subject, the important word <i>not</i> had been
omitted, so that whereas the minute directed that the
issue should not be delayed on account of certain preliminaries,
the letter directed that it should.</p>

<p>Two days later, a new difficulty appeared. The
objection raised at the Stamp Office to perform the
duty of cutting up into single covers the entire sheets
which came from the press, had prevented the construction
of proper machinery for the purpose; and
now a contest arose between two departments, the
Stamp Office persisting in issuing the sheets uncut,
and the Post Office very properly refusing to supply
its receivers with them until cut. The consequence of
this antagonism was that the cutting had to be carried
on throughout the following Sunday. I secured, however,
an additional machine for the Monday, and the
promise of another for the Wednesday. Nevertheless,
the delay produced considerable dissatisfaction; the
stamps issued having fallen, to a great extent, into
the hands of private venders, who naturally took
advantage of the demand to sell at a profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later, the issue threatened to come to a
standstill; the Post Office, though it had in writing
undertaken the duty of distributing the stamped
covers, now declaring such distribution beyond its
power. My inquiries merely produced a repetition of
this declaration; the nature of the obstacle I failed to
learn. As I was unwilling to call in the authority of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, indeed, at this
time was so much occupied as to be almost inaccessible,
I could but urge and remonstrate; and it was
some time before this produced the desired effect.
Even a month after the first issue, the London receivers
remained still unsupplied, the Post Office
alleging that it could not obtain stamps, and the
Stamp Office declaring that it had complied, and more
than complied, with all requisitions. The only thing
beyond doubt was that blame rested somewhere; but
where, it was hard to discover; the more so, as each
department was too much out of temper to allow of
easy interrogation. I scarcely need add that troubles
more or less similar to these continued to arise from
time to time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the actual production could scarcely
keep pace with the public demand; the less so as
this took the unexpected form already implied; adhesive
stamps so fast rising in preference, that the
great stock of covers which had been prepared proved
of comparatively little value. The presses actually at
work were producing more than half a million of
stamps per day, but this was insufficient, and sudden
addition was not practicable, since, by a relay of
hands, the work was already carried on by night and
by day without intermission. Of course, such pressure
was not without its evils; some of the work being inaccurately
and even carelessly executed, so that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
began to fear that forgery might be successfully
attempted. My apprehensions, however, happily
proved groundless; only two attempts, so far as I
know, ever having been made, and both of a very
bungling character, though in one the author was
cunning enough to escape personal detection. In the
other, which occurred in Ireland, the offender was
convicted and punished; the detection occurred through
the fact that a young man had written to his sweetheart
under one of the forged stamps, and enclosed another
for her use in reply.</p>

<p>Amidst these anxieties another arose, which proved
far more durable and more troublesome. This proceeded
from the difficulty of making the obliteration
of the stamp complete and effectual. All the penny
stamps, it must be observed, were at this time printed
in black; the obliterating ink being red; used, I
suppose, because that colour had long been employed
in the Post Office to indicate prepayment. Of course
the danger was, first, lest obliteration should be
omitted; and, secondly, lest the effacing marks
should afterwards be removed. Even on the first
point there was a good deal to complain of in the
outset; so much so that a certain amount of discredit
began to attach to stamps as a whole. The Post
Office replied to complaints by saying that every care
was taken; and no doubt serious difficulties would
arise in introducing a new mode, where so many
persons were concerned; these, too, being spread far
and wide over the kingdom.</p>

<p>An extract from my Journal, a few days later, shows
how matters were getting on:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 21st.</i>—Several more cases of stamps wholly unobliterated,
or very nearly so, have come within my knowledge; and all sorts of
tricks are being played by the public, who are exercising their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
ingenuity in devising contrivances for removing the obliterative
stamp, by chemical agents and other means. One contrivance is
to wash over the stamp, before the letter is posted, with isinglass, or
something else which acts as a varnish, and as the obliterating stamp
falls on this varnish, it is easily removed with soap and water.
Tricks of this kind are quite sufficiently numerous to produce great
annoyance; but I doubt whether it is more than the exercise of a
little ingenuity which will speedily be directed to other objects. I
am making every effort, however, with the aid of Phillips, the
chemist,<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and others, to prevent these frauds, and I trust I shall
succeed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Seven days later I find the following entry:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 28th.</i>—To-day Lord John Russell sent a blank sheet of
paper, which some impudent fellow had addressed to him, using a
label which had evidently been used before, for the features were
entirely washed away. Nevertheless, it was passed at the Post
Office. Whiting, the printer, also sent a note his brother had received
from Brighton, the stamp of which was so slightly obliterated
that the mark was scarcely visible, and by night would almost
certainly pass.”</p>

</div>

<p>This took me next day to the Post Office, where I
remained during the two busiest hours of the day,
witnessing operations. I give the following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 29th.</i>—The tricks with the stamps are, Mr. Bokenham says,
abating; and, practically, he thinks there is no danger of their being
used twice, now that ink for obliteration has been supplied to the
deputy-postmasters from the Central Office—a measure which I
advised in the first instance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nevertheless, more than a fortnight later, I find the
following entry:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pressly<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> assured me that he continually receives letters the
stamps of which have not been cancelled. That he has sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
so frequently to Colonel Maberly that he does not like to send any
more, lest it should be thought annoying. He gave me one recently
received.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime, as the red ink seemed inefficacious, black
ink was tried; and, for a time, this appeared to be
effectual.</p>

<p>Additional security was also sought in legislation;
advantage being taken by Mr. Timm, the Solicitor to
the Stamp Office, of a bill then preparing on postal
affairs, to introduce a clause enabling the Postmaster-General
to open any letter bearing a forged stamp,
or a stamp used for the second time; but as the
Chancellor of the Exchequer felt sure that Parliament
would not grant such a power, the clause, very much
to Mr. Timm’s regret and my own, was struck out.
We were, therefore, thrown back upon chemical and
mechanical means of defence. It soon appeared that
these must be put into further requisition, Mr. Donovan,
a chemist of Dublin, having succeeded in removing
the effacing black mark without injuring the
stamp below. The stamp, it must be remembered,
had been impressed by powerful machinery, and likewise
had had time to dry; while the obliteration was
produced only by hand, and remained fresh. Again,
therefore, I had to call in Mr. Phillips. He came
accompanied by Dr. Clark, Professor of Chemistry
in the University of Aberdeen, who had kindly
volunteered his services, and who suggested a number
of experiments, which Mr. Phillips undertook to try.
On the same day, however, Mr. Phillips reported
favourably of a new kind of ink devised by a Mr.
Parsons, informing me, nevertheless, that it had yet
to be subjected to various tests.</p>

<p>At this juncture came a formal report from the
Post Office, stating that the red ink was found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
removable, and asking for instructions. The statement,
though necessarily made as a matter of form, came to
me as a mere truism; but the request for instructions
was more easily made than complied with; for about
the same time Mr. Parsons’ ink yielded to the skill of
Messrs. Perkins and Co., contractors for the supply
of adhesive stamps; who, however, reported in turn,
that they had prepared two other kinds of ink, either
of which they thought would answer the purpose. I
lost no time in setting Mr. Phillips to work on the
subject; and, in my anxiety, went so far as to trouble
the greatest chemist of the age. Kindly giving me
the needful attention, though in an extremely depressed
state of health, the result of excessive labour—a
fact, of course, unknown to me when I made my
application—Mr. Faraday approved of the course
which I submitted to him, viz., that an aqueous ink
should be used, both for the stamps and for obliteration,
so soon as the stock of stamps now on hand
should be exhausted, and that, in the mean time,
obliteration should be made with black printing-ink.
As the stock of covers was so large that, considering
its little favour with the public, it was likely to last some
years; and as, in dealing with those, an oleaginous
effacing ink was indispensable, while, nevertheless, it
would be impracticable to have two kinds of effacing
ink in use at the same time, it was important to procure
a destructible oleaginous ink to be used meanwhile
in printing the adhesive stamps. I accordingly requested
Mr. Phillips, and also Mr. Bacon, of the firm
of Perkins and Co., to undertake the task; which they
did.</p>

<p>The new oleaginous ink, produced on the above
application, seemed at first to answer well; but past
failure led me to doubt present results. Meantime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
endless suggestions were coming from various quarters,
all requiring to be more or less considered,
and many plausible enough to deserve trial, but all
ending, sooner or later, in failure. The worry of this
continued succession of hope and disappointment made
me at last almost afraid to enter my office; where
I foreknew that some untoward report must be
awaiting me.</p>

<p>At length I drew up a Report, containing all the
information then possessed, and recommending, for
the present, obliteration with good black printing-ink,
prepared in a peculiar manner, and the printing of the
adhesive stamps in coloured inks—blue, as before, for
the twopenny ones, but red for the penny ones; both
colours, however, to be oleaginous, but at the same
time destructible; my aim being to render the obliteration
so much more tenacious than the postage stamp
that any attempt at removing the former must involve
the destruction of the latter.</p>

<p>The new labels being thus far provided for, anxiety
remained as to the stock of all kinds still on hand.
It was still hoped, however, that thoroughly good
printer’s-ink would answer the purpose sufficiently to
prevent any serious abuse; but within three weeks
from the date of my Report, a chemist named Watson
had succeeded completely in the removal of this obliteration
also. His process, however, though very
simple, inexpensive, and effectual in relation, at least,
to the black stamp, proved so slow as to demand nine
minutes per label in its application; so that the danger
to be apprehended was not very formidable. To prevent
even this, however, Mr. Watson proposed an
obliterating ink which he regarded as quite irremovable.
So indeed it proved; but nevertheless its
use was inadmissible, because it both injured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
paper and obliterated the writing in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson’s attempts to remove the black ink
from the red stamp seemed, after an interval of some
weeks, to succeed. Fortunately, the success was only
apparent, nor, so far as I am aware, has practical
success been subsequently achieved by any one; so
that the mode then adopted still remains in satisfactory
use.</p>

<p>Still, however, temporary difficulties remained, and,
yet worse, increased: the process of removing black
from black, which Mr. Watson could carry on but
slowly, my clerk, Mr. Ledingham, whose ingenuity
had dealt effectually with many previous devices, succeeded
in carrying on at the rate of one per minute;
a rate quite quick enough to make knavery very
profitable. After much thought I hit upon a device
which is thus recorded in my Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 9th.</i>—It occurred to me that, as the means which were
successful in removing the printing-ink obliterant were different from
those which discharged Perkins’s ink, a secure ink might perhaps be
obtained by simply mixing the two, and some trials made to-day lead
me to hope that this plan will succeed. Perhaps certain ingredients
of Perkins’s ink, added to the printing-ink, would do equally well.”</p>

</div>

<p>This device succeeded, the ink so formed proving to
be indestructible. Now, at length, all seemed to be
right; but one more difficulty yet remained. To
enable this ink to dry with sufficient rapidity, it had
been necessary to introduce a small quantity of volatile
oil; and the smell thus produced was declared at the
Post Office to be intolerable. Happily, means were
soon found for removing the offence; and so, at length,
a little before the close of the year, all requirements
were met.</p>

<p>But the most grievous trouble that arose to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
in connection with these cares remains to be told.
When, from the causes already shown, and others
yet to be described, I was almost overborne with
labour and anxiety, there came a new trouble for
which I was quite unprepared; and which, like the
last straw, was enough to break the camel’s back. A
blow aimed at my brother was a precursor of what
subsequently befell myself, though with a difference
that will presently appear. Before proceeding, I am
bound to mention that, at a later period, and after
time had brought about some personal change at the
Stamp Office, everything was done to make amends
for this wrong. My brother’s services were fully, nay,
handsomely recognised, his powers greatly extended,
and his emoluments enlarged.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, June 29th.</i>—A letter has been addressed by the Commissioners
of Stamps and Taxes to the Treasury, setting forth, and
greatly exaggerating, the exertions of its own officers with regard to
the postage stamps, saying not a word of Edwin’s exertions, which
have been much greater than those of any one else, but adding that,
as, from the unpopularity of the covers and envelopes, it will probably
be unnecessary to manufacture any more, and as certain
arrangements which they propose can be adopted with regard to the
labels and stamped paper, it will be unnecessary to employ Edwin
any longer. The fact is, that they are utterly ignorant of machinery
and of the difficulties it presents, and are consequently unable to
appreciate Edwin’s peculiar powers. In their opinion the whole
difficulty consists in the distribution of the stamps and in going
through certain forms for their registration. At the very moment
that they propose to dispense with his services, Edwin is applying
counters to Barnes’ presses, is improving the presses to be employed
in stamping the paper of the public (which before he took them in
hand were for this purpose quite worthless), and is preparing one of
a superior construction. If the business is left in the hands of the
Commissioners without such aid as Edwin gives, my opinion is that
we shall soon be in a mess.”</p>

</div>

<p>After some delay, arising from the Chancellor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Exchequer’s close occupation, I succeeded in laying
the case fully before him. He at once expressed
agreement in my view of the question, and the result
was that, happily alike for my brother and for the
public convenience, five months later the obnoxious
letter was withdrawn; and my brother, though for a
time subjected to more or less of annoyance, was never
afterwards disturbed in his office. On the contrary,
some years later his superintendence, originally confined
to the postage department, was extended to the
whole stamping system.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of stamps, I must say a
few words about the form in which the adhesive
stamps are printed, and the mode of their production.
It may be necessary to inform those who buy stamps
only in small quantities—probably the great mass of
her Majesty’s subjects—that, as I originally proposed,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
the whole sheet of penny stamps contains two hundred
and forty, the equivalent, of course, of £1; and that
as each row contains twelve stamps, the £1 is easily
divisible into shillings, while the shillings, in like
manner, may be promptly reduced to pieces worth
respectively sixpence, fourpence, twopence, or a single
penny. In the outset it was foreseen that the stamps
might be used in ordinary payments.</p>

<p>As regards the production of stamps, it must be
premised that two qualities were indispensable; first,
cheapness; secondly, security against imitation. To
obtain this latter quality, it was necessary to have
excellence both of design and of workmanship,
together with exact uniformity in the whole number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
issued—requirements which made extreme cheapness
difficult.</p>

<p>The Queen’s head was first engraved by hand on a
single matrix; the effigy being encompassed with lines
too fine for any hand, or even any but the most delicate
machinery to engrave. The matrix being subsequently
hardened, was employed to produce impressions on a
soft steel roller of sufficient circumference to receive
twelve; and this being hardened in turn, was used,
under very heavy pressure, to produce and repeat its
counterpart on a steel-plate, to such extent that this,
when used in printing, produced at each impression
two hundred and forty stamps; all this being of
course done, as machinists will at once perceive,
according to the process invented by the late Mr.
Perkins.</p>

<p>In this manner there were produced in the first
fifteen years more than three thousand millions of
stamps; all, as being derived from the same matrix,
of course absolutely uniform. At the end of that time
it was thought desirable to create a second matrix, but
as this was obtained by transfer from the first—save
that the lines were deepened by hand—the deviation
from identity was at most very slight. With plates
procured from this, the process, however, being somewhat
modified, there had been printed, up to July,
1867, more than seven thousand millions of stamps;
thus making up a total of considerably more
than ten thousand millions, in all of which the
impression is, for all practical purposes, absolutely
uniform.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Now it will easily be perceived that, if imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
cannot be effected without resort to the means described
above, as used in the production of the stamps,
forgery is in effect impracticable; since no forger can
have the command of very powerful, delicate, and
therefore costly machinery, requiring for its management
skilful, and therefore highly-paid, workmen.
If the Queen’s head alone constituted the effigy,
something in imitation might be done by the aid of
lithography, or some other such copying process; but
this fails when applied to the extremely delicate lines
already mentioned as constituting the background;
which in the lithographer’s hands do but smirch the
paper.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is thrown in the way of the forger
by the letters placed at the four corners of each stamp;
which will be found to vary in every one of the two
hundred and forty impressions comprised in a sheet;
the necessary modification being made in each steel-plate
by means of a hand punch. By this arrangement
the forger is compelled either to resort to the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
complexity, or to issue his counterfeits in single stamps,
all identical in their lettering; a proceeding which, if
carried to any remunerative extent, would inevitably
lead to detection. Of the additional security derived
from the use of a portrait in the stamp, an advantage
long ago recognised in coinage, it will suffice to remark
that of all depictions a portrait is perhaps the one in
which change, however slight, is most easily discovered,
especially by those who have it continually before their
eye. We all know that no strange face could have
more than a moment’s chance of passing for that of a
familiar friend.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUBSIDIARY PROCEEDINGS.</span></h3>

<p>Concurrently with all these transactions, many
and various matters, some of them of great importance,
demanded attention.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> As letters multiplied, so
also, to my surprise and concern, did complaints relative
to theft; and that in a much greater ratio. This,
as I afterwards learnt, was consequent upon a change
at the Post Office, made, unluckily, without notification
to the Treasury. A wholesome practice had previously
existed of registering every letter supposed to contain
articles of value; but, under the pressure caused by
the increase of letters, this precaution had been abandoned.
Of course, the remedy was to revive it; but
here difficulties arose. No fee had previously been
charged; and now that it was rightly thought necessary
that the trouble of registration should be paid for, a
question arose as to what the charge should be; the
rates proposed by the Post Office, viz., one shilling for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
general post letters, and twopence for district post
letters, seemed to me doubly objectionable; first, as to
excess in the former of the two charges, and secondly,
as to variety without sufficient reason; my wish being
for a uniform rate, and that on no account higher than
sixpence. This difference of opinion, combined with
extreme difficulty of access to the ever-occupied Chancellor
of the Exchequer, delayed the measure; but at
length, thinking it better to obtain what I could, in the
hope of subsequent improvement, I gave way so far as
to agree to a uniform rate of one shilling; and procured
for that measure the approbation of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.</p>

<p>As another means of diminishing theft, I proposed
a reduction of the fee for money orders; and this also
was carried into effect; the rates being reduced from
6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> for any sum not exceeding £2; and from
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> for any higher sum up to £5. This
reduction, combined with the low postage charged on
transmission, had the effect of increasing the number of
money-orders in ten years by more than twenty-fold.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The most troublesome and unsatisfactory duty now
devolving upon me was resistance to needless increase
of expense. I found, with great concern, that
augmentation was proceeding rapidly; and, indeed,
the addition during the first year of penny postage
amounted to something more than £100,000;<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> that,
too, following an increase of £70,000 in the previous
year; an amount sufficient to produce a very serious
injury to fiscal results, the whole of which I well knew
would be by many attributed to my reform.</p>

<p>The increase was partly due to what was, in one
point of view, an untoward coincidence, viz., the concurrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
extension of the railway system. For though
this tended greatly to the convenience of correspondents,
and therefore to increase in the amount of
correspondence, yet its effect in augmenting postal
expenditure was quite startling. That an improvement
which has so prodigiously cheapened the conveyance
of passengers and goods should have greatly raised
the cost of conveying the mails, however paradoxical,
is demonstrably true, as indeed appears by the following
simple statement.</p>

<p>The total charge for carrying the inland mails in the
year 1835 (that before the writing of my pamphlet)
was £225,920;<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and it will be remembered that the
mail-coaches were then so lightly loaded as to admit
of a manifold increase in burden without much addition
to their number. By the end of 1840, when the
number of chargeable letters had little more than
doubled, while that of free missives must have greatly
decreased, this charge had risen to £333,418,<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and at
the present time (1868) it appears to be as high as
£718,480.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Of course, great benefit to the Post Office is derived
from the vast increase in speed, and greater allowance
of space; but while in all these the public has its full
share, it enjoys at the same time that great reduction
in expense, which contrasts so remarkably with the
increased charge to the Post Office. To a limited
extent, explanation is to be found in the loss of that
immunity from tolls which in England all mail-coaches
enjoyed on the old roads; but the main augmentation
is attributable to circumstances which could not be considered
without a too-long digression. The increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
was and is unquestionable; and the coincidence, as
already implied, was misleading, giving an excellent
handle to the enemies of the reform, and demanding of
its friends a longer explanation than the public had
time or inclination to follow.</p>

<p>A far less serious but more harassing increase of
expense arose out of demands for augmented salaries,
allowances, &amp;c., which now poured in from all sides;
and which came to the Treasury, backed by recommendation
from the Post Office authorities; the Chief
Office seeming never to question the judgment of the
local surveyors, save when there appeared plausible
ground for advising yet further augmentation. The
reasons advanced were sometimes so insufficient that it
was impossible for me, knowing the bitter hostility still
entertained towards Penny Postage and its author, to
avoid the suspicion that the care incumbent on such
occasions was willingly set aside; that increased expenditure
was almost welcomed as a means of fulfilling
adverse prediction.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable were two cases afterwards
stated in my evidence before a Parliamentary Committee.
Additional allowances to two postmasters (at
Swinford and Ballaghaderin in Ireland) were proposed,
on the ground that the money-order business had become
so heavy that each postmaster was obliged to engage a
clerk to attend to that duty alone. The accounts in
the Post Office would of course have supplied a check
to this statement; but it came to the Treasury vouched,
first, by the surveyor of the district; second, by the
Dublin office; and third, by the London office. The
Treasury, at my suggestion, however, called for information
as to the actual number of money-orders
paid and issued by each office in a given time; and
after the lapse of a year the information was supplied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
when it appeared that the actual number of money-orders
paid and issued, when taken together, was in
one office only three per day, and in the other only
two. I advised the rejection of the proposed allowances;
but this question, with many others of a similar
character, remained undecided when my duties were
interrupted.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>I thus found myself engaged in a constant succession
of petty contests, often unavailing, and always invidious;
since, while ever called on to resist the
demands of the undeserving, I was debarred, by my
position, from originating any recommendation in
favour of the deserving; a disadvantage under which
I laboured for many years, and which seriously clogged
my efforts for subsequent improvement.</p>

<p>The information, too, for rightly weighing these
various claims, though very accessible to the Post
Office, was to me difficult and uncertain of attainment;
since, in the investigation, I had of necessity to act
through those to whom I stood opposed, and who
were naturally unwilling to be found in the wrong.
The plan which after some experience I adopted was
as follows. I induced the Treasury to issue an instruction
to the Postmaster-General that every
application for increased force or salary at a provincial
office should be accompanied with a detailed
statement (in accordance with a printed form prepared
by myself) of the work and expenditure of such office.
By making good use of these, I gradually arrived at
averages which I used as guides in subsequent cases,
and thus became enabled to exercise a salutary control.
Doubtless many applications were altogether prevented
by the conviction that the statement would not justify
the demand: in some instances such statement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
withheld on the plea of urgency; a move which was
met by a temporary grant of force, to be made permanent
if shown to be needful. Other modes were tried,
but in the end lack of success effectually checked unwarranted
attempts. I may add that the plan is still
in use, is found to save much perplexity at the Post
Office, and has operated beneficially in at once preventing
needless expenditure and in enabling the
Office to do prompt justice to well-founded claims.</p>

<p>I have already implied that movements were impeded,
and labour increased, by difficulty of access to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer; but it should be
added that this went so far, especially during the
parliamentary session, that pressing affairs were sometimes
kept for weeks, and even months, awaiting his
decision. When, at length, the end of the session
came, the exhausted minister felt the imperative
demand for rest; and resolved to take six weeks’
holiday. The reader who has accompanied me
through the last three years will not wonder to find
that I had a like requirement: I, therefore, requested
and obtained leave of absence for the same period.
What proportion of this furlough was available for
its purpose to the Chancellor, I, of course, cannot
exactly say; it is sufficient for me to speak for
myself. As the difficulties relative to obliteration
were still upon me, I should not have left town
but from absolute necessity; and even in going I
was obliged to make such arrangements as could
scarcely fail of producing recall; knowing, too, all the
time, that even while I was away, many papers would
of necessity be referred to me; so that, at best, my
days of vacation would be but half-holidays.</p>

<p>Leaving home on August 14th, I got on pretty well
for five days; when, amongst various papers, came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Postmaster-General’s formal announcements relative to
the failure of obliteration, with a request from the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that I would report upon
it. While I was dealing with this, I received, on the
21st, the notice that Mr. Parsons’ obliterating ink had
proved ineffectual; and my anxiety was so great, that
though but a week of my holiday was gone, I determined
on an almost immediate return to town.</p>

<p>After nine days spent on the matter which had recalled
me, and other business at my office, thinking
matters now in tolerable train, I again left town;
going, however, only to Ramsgate, that I might keep
within call, and arranging to receive a daily report of
progress. Altogether, I had this time an interval of
twelve days, interrupted only by the daily receipt of
papers which I could deal with where I was; but on
September 13th I was again recalled:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, September 13th, Sunday.</i>—Received a note from Mr.
Gordon, stating that Lord Melbourne has applied to him for information
as to the causes of the ‘continued and increasing
deficiency of the Post Office revenue’ (I think these are the
words), and as to the future prospects, and requesting I will enable
him to supply it with as little delay as possible. As I cannot, while
at Ramsgate, give this information, or rather satisfy Lord Melbourne
that the revenue is not decreasing in reality, ... I decided on
returning at once to town, and came away by the packet at eleven
o’clock.”</p>

</div>

<p>Four days were now occupied mainly in procuring
the information thus called for, and in drawing up my
Report on the subject; in which the increase in charges
for conveyance had to take a conspicuous part; but on
the 18th I again returned to Ramsgate, where fortunately
I was able to remain until the 30th, my term of
holiday having been considerately extended by a week,
on account of interruptions. I have already shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was working
as hard as myself; abundant evidence of this might
be produced from my Journal, but I will give only
one more extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>December 24th.</i>—Saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer for
‘three minutes,’ left with him, for Christmas Day reading, a long
report on the new envelopes, a minute thereon, a form to be filled
up in all cases in which application is made for advancing the expenses
of any office, and some other papers.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have now little left to complete the history of this
year. Among other expedients I had recommended
the introduction of pillar letter-boxes as they are now
usually called; a plan which in its essential part I had
seen in use in France some years before:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 9th.</i>—A day or two ago there was a letter in the
Times suggesting that a letter-box should be put up in Westminster
Hall, for the convenience of the lawyers. I thought this a good
opportunity to propose an experiment on my plan for having letter-boxes
put up throughout London and other towns, in the great
thoroughfares and other places of resort; the letters being taken out
by the messengers now employed to collect from the receiving
houses. Mr. Baring consents to the plan being tried in Westminster
Hall: if successful it will add greatly to the public
convenience (when extended), and will save some thousands a-year
in London alone.”<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Baring’s consent was, I believe, acted upon;
but I had accomplished little more in this direction
when the interruption occurred to which I have already
adverted.</p>

<p>However, as the year of which I am now speaking
(1840) advanced, increase in the number of letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
began to show that steady progress which has never
since been interrupted. Before the end of June this
was pretty manifest, and by the middle of November
progress was not only steady but rapid.</p>

<p>I insert here the following extracts from a letter
received somewhat later from Captain Basil Hall:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Portsmouth, Dec. 31, 1840.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—Many thanks for your agreeable information.
Indeed I have no doubt—nor ever had—that your admirable
invention (for it well deserves that name) will ere long make up
the Post Office revenue to what it was. To say nothing of the
enormous advantages which it brings along with it to all classes of
the community!</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“It strikes me, too, that a great convenience might be added to
the envelopes if there were put a small lick of the gum which is
used for the stamps at the angle where the wafer or wax is put; so
that an envelope might be closed without the trouble of a wafer or
the double ‘toil and trouble’ of a seal—implying lucifer-matches,
tapers, and wax. I can easily see how one hundred, or any number
of envelopes, might have this small touch of gum applied to them
at a dash of a brush. But, indeed, the manufacture of envelopes—supposing
Government were to take it in hand—would be so enormous
that a small profit on each would realise a great sum. Every
one now uses envelopes, which save a world of time; and if you
were to furnish the means of closing the letter by an adhesive corner
a still further saving of time would take place.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“I dare say you are sadly bothered with crude suggestions; but
my heart is so completely in your noble scheme—the greatest of the
day—that I venture to intrude occasionally.</p>

<p class="center">“Ever most truly yours,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Basil Hall</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is, so far as I am aware, the first mention of
that now almost universal practice, which has nearly
made wafers and sealing-wax things of the past.</p>

<p>On December 15th I first saw, in my brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Edwin’s room at Somerset House, and in its earliest
form that envelope-folding machine which attracted so
much attention at the first International Exhibition,
and is now in constant and extensive use. In the
model it already seemed to do its work very well, but
the labour of some years was yet required to complete
its adaptation to its purpose. In this latter part of the
process my brother received important assistance from
Mr. Warren De La Rue, who in the end purchased
the patent.</p>

<p>The following passage shows that the close of the
year was full of anxiety for that which was to
follow:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>December 31st.</i>—The Post Office expenses are increasing at an
enormous rate. As nearly as I can ascertain the present rate of
expenditure is about £900,000 per annum, which is an increase of
more than £200,000 in the last two years: the greater part of the
increase results from the employment of railways, and cannot
perhaps be avoided (though I think much may be done even
there to reduce the charge), but a considerable portion is owing to
the increase of establishments. In the first half of the present year
the expenses of the several establishments were increased at the rate
of about £20,000 per annum, and I fear that at least an equal
increase has taken place in the last half of the year. Nearly the
whole of this increase of establishments might, I believe, have been
avoided.”</p>

</div>

<p>Before closing the narrative of this year, I may
mention one or two incidents of an amusing character.</p>

<p>Soon after the issue of the adhesive stamp, a distinguished
connoisseur, reading the direction to affix the
stamp “on the right-hand side of the letter,” felt a
doubt as to what this might really mean. Being in the
artistic habit of reversing sides in speaking of pictures,
and probably having done so in the case of Mulready’s
beautiful though unacceptable design, he wished to
know whether the term “right” were to be received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the artistic or the common sense. Accordingly, knocking
at the office window, he modestly requested to be
informed which was the right-hand side of the letter,
when he was repulsed with the counter-demand, “Do
you think we have nothing to do but to answer idle
questions?” the window at the same time closing with
a bang.</p>

<p>In the same year there was, as may be still remembered,
much public excitement in expectation of Her
Majesty’s first accouchement; lively interest turning
upon the question whether the nation would be blessed
with a prince or princess. Amongst other speculation
on the subject, doubtless a good deal went on in
the room where the three messengers passed most of
their time, with little else to do than to discuss the
topics of the day, of which they probably supposed
every one’s head to be as full as their own. For myself,
as I was during the whole period engaged in the
earnest effort to give my plan that full development
which was essential to its success, I fear I did not give
to the great question all the attention which its importance
demanded; and even when the grand announcement
was matter of hourly expectation, I was completely
absorbed in the device of means for overcoming one or
other of the numberless difficulties with which I had
to contend. In the midst of this research the door
was suddenly thrown open by my messenger, with a
loud exclamation, “A Princess Royal, Sir!” As the
sounds which reached my ear did not inform my
understanding, I merely looked up from my paper
with the inquiry, “Who?” and the announcement,
though repeated, still conveying but half-meaning, the
only result was that I started up from my chair, in
surprise and perplexity, with a direction to my messenger
that he should “show the lady upstairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>I close the year’s history in a manner very pleasing
to myself by transcribing the following extract from a
letter received in the course of it from one to whose
works I felt, in common with many of my contemporaries,
deeply indebted; and whose name I can
never mention but with gratitude and respect:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Captain Beaufort<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> told you very truly that I take
a strong interest in the progress of the Penny Postage—both a
public and a private interest; and I truly think that the British
nation, the united empire, owes you millions of thanks for the
improvements that have been made in social intercourse—in all
the intercourse of human creatures for pleasure or business, affection
or profit; including the profits of literature and science—foreign and
domestic.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“I am, dear Sir,</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROGRESS UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</span></h3>

<p>At the opening of 1841 I had been a year and a
quarter in office; and, as has been seen, had been
enabled, by dint of great efforts, backed by the increasing
confidence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
to bring into operation the most striking parts of my
plan; those, indeed, which many, probably most,
people at the time regarded as the whole plan; though
the reader must be aware that very much was still
lacking to its completion, to say nothing of those
further improvements of which I was necessarily
getting sight as I advanced in my work. If it had
ever been supposed by Government that the whole
plan could be established within the two years for
which alone I had been engaged, either unfounded
expectations must have been held as to Post Office
co-operation, or I must have been accredited with such
energy—moral and physical—such powers of convincing,
persuading, or over-riding, as have been
vouchsafed to few indeed. I had worked, and was
still working, to the utmost extent of my power; but
not only was every onward step retarded by the adverse
feeling and cumbrous routine already referred to,
but, as has been seen, the very maintenance of Stamp
Office and Post Office action in such efficiency as to
prevent clog or disaster, had demanded of me almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
incessant watchfulness and exertion. In short, it might
by this time have been perceived that to give full effect
even to my published plan would require at least
several years of unremitting labour; while the field of
postal improvement, taken as a whole, was (as, indeed,
it still is) absolutely boundless. However, I felt at
this time no further anxiety about the durability of my
engagement than such as related to the stability of the
existing administration. Not only had Mr. Baring
expressed in words his increasing confidence, but yet
greater assurance came to me from his increasing
readiness to adopt my suggestions (whenever I could
get opportunity to explain them), and from his leaving
the routine work, so great in amount, more and more
to my decision. Nay, should there arrive the calamitous
event just alluded to, the exchange of the Liberal
for a Tory Administration, I could not avoid indulging
in the hope that even the latter, accepting the new
order of things as they had done on a far greater question<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
six years before, might, if only in a spirit of
emulation, carry on the good work; retaining my
services as a necessary means to the end. Should the
reader be inclined to think that I was dwelling too
much on my own interests, let him review all the main
circumstances, and I think he will judge me more
charitably. Let him remember how important complete
efficiency in the plan was, alike to public
convenience and fiscal ends; let him remember that
in the Post Office itself the plan was already declared
a failure; that its very permanence was yet problematical:
let him consider all the reasons there were
to believe that the great ends in question could be
attained only by the constant efforts of one who combined,
with the knowledge drawn from long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
laborious investigation, a personal interest so deep
that failure in this would seem to be failure in all, and
he will not find it very hard to understand how, apart
from private considerations (to which, nevertheless, I
could not be insensible), I looked upon the retention of
my post as a point of almost vital importance.</p>

<p>However, though these thoughts could not but pass
through my mind, their only immediate effect was to
confirm my previous determination (if that could be
strengthened) to make myself so useful that my
services should be regarded as indispensable. I had
yet to learn that men in power do not always prefer
public good to party advantage. Meantime, was it
possible that I misapprehended the state of feeling
at the Post Office in respect of my plan and myself?
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, friendly as he had
shown himself to both, held a more favourable opinion,
and might he not be in the right? Events were in
progress towards the complete resolution of this
question; but, meantime, the difference of opinion
between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and me
was necessarily an obstacle to progress, since it led
me to urge what he was often at first, and sometimes
at last, inclined to resist.</p>

<p>I must admit, however, that the first passage in my
Journal for the year 1841 which bears at all on the
question of Post Office management is far from being
of an adverse character; it is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>January 16th.</i>—Yesterday I wrote by post to Colonel Maberly
to ask for certain information which was supposed to exist, but which
could not be found in the Treasury, owing to their having no index
to their minutes, and I was only able to indicate very vaguely what I
wanted. To-day I received copies of a letter from the Postmaster-General
to the Treasury and the reply, both [written] in 1837, containing
the information I desired. I mention this to show that the
Post Office still deserves the high reputation it has long enjoyed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
promptitude in replying to letters (no unimportant convenience to
those who, like myself, have frequent occasion to address it) and
because, as I have frequently to find fault, I am the more anxious to
praise when I can do it conscientiously.”</p>

</div>

<p>It may be not unprofitable to mention an arrangement
at the Post Office, explaining, in a measure, its
habitual promptitude in reply. The papers constantly
accumulating in the Secretary’s office, I should think,
at the rate of a small cart-load per week, are in the
keeping, not of clerks, but of a corps of messengers,
chosen from the general body for their superior intelligence.
These, under one of their own number,
manage the whole business of tying up, docketing,
indexing, and arranging; and are always ready on
occasion for the duty of research. The whole is
admirably managed; and, contrary to what any one
would have expected, is believed to be better done
than it would be by men of higher station. Many
years after the events now in narration, it was hastily
thought, in a general revision of duties, that the head
officer of the corps should be taken from a higher
grade; but the change was found far from beneficial,
and was soon reversed. The explanation seems to be
that the higher officer, thinking himself rather lowered
by his new employment, the more so as handling dusty
papers must, in some degree, have marred the results
of his toilet, discharged the duty in but a perfunctory
manner; while those of the lower grade, justly regarding
themselves as raised in trust and position,
executed it as men perform a task in which they take
pride.</p>

<p>It has been seen how much care was taken to prevent
unlawful practices relative to the stamp; and the
experience of many years attests the efficacy of the
means adopted. Of course, too, when discovery, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
seeming discovery, was made of a flaw in our security,
the fact was carefully withheld from the public during
the period of experiment and rectification. What,
then, was my surprise and vexation at an occurrence
thus recorded in my Journal?—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>February 18th.</i>—In the <i>Post</i> and <i>Herald</i> of this morning is a
notice of a lecture at the Polytechnic Institution, from which it
would appear that the lecturer exhibited electrotype imitations of the
medallion stamp, stating, at the same time, that they could be imitated
with the greatest ease, that they had consequently been
abandoned, and that he was authorised by Government to make a
series of experiments connected therewith. I immediately showed
the paragraph to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a view of
ascertaining if he had given any such authority. He had not.”</p>

</div>

<p>On Mr. Cole’s applying at the Polytechnic Institution,
the authorities there produced an official letter
from Colonel Maberly, authorising the experiments in
question, and stating that he would bear them harmless.
It must be added that the experiments thus
injuriously made were but a repetition of processes
performed some months before, under proper authority,
by Mr. Palmer, of Newgate Street; and, further, that
as the stamp had now been officially registered, no
attempt at imitation could be lawfully made save by
authority of the Commissioners of Stamps; who,
again, would have to give power by a formal
warrant.</p>

<p>The Post Office condemnation of my plan, founded
on the slow progress in the number of letters, still
continuing, it was a little remarkable that there came
from the same quarter written warnings to the Treasury
of an expected “break-down” from excessive
increase:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, February 11th.</i>—[The Chancellor of the Exchequer
showed me] a note from Colonel Maberly which concludes thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>“If this weather lasts I fear we shall have a break-down. We are
dreadfully afflicted in London—at Derby they must have more
assistance—at Bristol our clerks won’t stay, their pay is too bad, and
those who do remain will be worked to death. We will do as well
as we can; but, take my word for it, we were never so near a break-down.’
Expressions of this kind have been rather frequent of late,
and it behoves me, I think, not altogether to disregard them. They
appear to me to be intended to be understood thus—there will be a
break-down, but the fault is not ours; the blame rests with the new
system and those who forced it upon us. My reply is, if Colonel
Maberly cannot carry on the new system he ought to resign; if he
remain in his present position, and there is a break-down, the fault is
clearly his; at all events, the blame must and ought to fall to his
share.</p>

<p>“<i>February 23rd.</i>—[Lord Lichfield, in a note to Mr. Baring] talks
in the same manner as Colonel Maberly, but even more strongly, of
the danger of a break-down.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“I found Mr. Baring had acted with his usual decision. He had
written to desire that Lord Lichfield would state explicitly the
dangers he apprehended, and the additional strength required; after
which we shall look into the cases, and then he will see Lord Lichfield
and Colonel Maberly on the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>It will have been observed that the apprehensions
set forth above are coupled with allegations of necessity
for increased force; and such demands, if granted
as fast as they were made, would have defeated all
hope of that large economy which, in my calculations,
was counted upon from simplification of operations.
Of the lavish course taken I proceed to give some
further indication:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, January 29th.</i>—Had some conversation with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer as to future proceedings. He is becoming
uneasy, like myself, at the extravagant and heedless demands
(apparently) of the Post Office for increased force.</p>

<p>“<i>March 27th.</i>—The Postmaster-General having made a second
application for two additional clerks in the Accountant-General’s
Office, and two more in the Accountant for Ireland’s Office, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
intimated that a further addition will probably be required in Edinburgh,
all on account of the quarterly returns ordered some time
back, I wrote to Court [the London Accountant-General] to request
he would call upon me on the subject, to bring copies of the forms
they have sent out, &amp;c., in order that I may judge what additional
strength is really necessary.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Court, calling as requested, though not till
eleven days afterwards, I found that the demand for
increased force was made in exclusive reference to
these quarterly returns, which were entirely needless,
as monthly returns, answering every purpose, were
already received on the same subject. Mr. Court
acknowledged this, but added that they had been
ordered by Colonel Maberly. The Chancellor of
the Exchequer, to whom I applied on the subject,
informed me next day that Colonel Maberly and
Mr. Court would adopt any plan for making these
returns that I might suggest in writing. I had only
to advise that they should not be made at all.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 12th.</i>—The Postmaster-General having applied for what I
considered a very extravagant establishment for the money-order
office in Dublin, I drew a minute calling for information as to the
whole amount of [money-order] poundage collected in Ireland, &amp;c.;
when it appeared, as I expected, that such amount fell short of the
minimum cost of the proposed establishment in Dublin alone. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer, on my recommendation, has cut down
the salaries considerably.</p>

<p>“<i>May 25th.</i>—Managed to get about a quarter of an hour with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which eight or ten cases were
decided; in several instances the Postmaster-General’s application
for increased expenses in different offices being disallowed.”</p>

</div>

<p>The vigilance I had now so long exercised in relation
to Post Office accounts was by no means allowed
to abate. The following curious instance shows that
even when Post Office and Stamp Office worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
together the resulting accounts might remain open to
question:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, April 1st.</i>—In going over the proof sheets of that part
of the annual finance accounts which relates to the Post Office, I
was led to suspect from their appearance that the proceeds of postage
stamps sold by the Stamp Office in Ireland had been carried to
the credit of the British, instead of the Irish, Post Office. Went to
the Stamp Office to inquire. Mr. Pressly was confident that so gross
a mistake could not have been made, but on inquiry it appeared that
my suspicions were well-founded. The consequence of the mistake
is that the British revenue appears to be about £15,000 more, and
the Irish revenue £15,000 less, than it really was. Mr. Charles
Crafer, who arranges the financial accounts in the Treasury, thinks
the account cannot now be altered, but he will append an explanatory
note. It is strange that the Irish [Post] Office should
have been satisfied with such a subtraction from their revenue, the
more so because it makes up the greater part of the apparent deficit;
the expenses in Ireland having exceeded the revenue, according to
the account, by about £21,000, though really by £6,000 only.
The Stamp Office will make arrangements for preventing such a
mistake in future.”</p>

</div>

<p>In connection with the subject of stamps, it should
be mentioned that in the course of this year Mr.
Pressly, secretary to the Stamp Office, having observed
that some of the provincial postmasters were also sub-distributors
of stamps for general purposes, suggested
the expediency of making such union the general
arrangement. This suggestion I reported to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was inclined to
act upon it to some extent. At Mr. Pressly’s request,
I wrote a minute on the subject, which was adopted by
the Treasury; but the suggestion, owing probably to
the change of Government which took place shortly
afterwards, was not carried into effect. After long
lying dormant it was revived in the year 1863 in a
Parliamentary Committee presided over by Mr. Horsfall,
before which I gave evidence in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
measure, but the Committee reported against it. My
opinion, however, still is that the vast organization of
the Post Office might be advantageously employed at
least for the distribution of all such stamps as are in
frequent demand.</p>

<p>In the following transaction the Post Office alone
was responsible:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, May 19th.</i>—Wrote two or three scolding minutes.
There have been several instances lately of great inaccuracy on the
part of one or two of the surveyors, who, in applying for authority
to increase the expenses at certain provincial offices, have been
guilty of, to say the least, very careless misrepresentations. In the
instance of the Cheltenham Office, the surveyor deducted £100
from the gross annual income of the postmaster for house rent,
whereas it afterwards appeared that the office is supplied rent free by
the inhabitants. This and many other inaccuracies almost equally
glaring have come before the Treasury unnoticed by the Post
Office.”</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing circumstances might scarcely be
worth mentioning, did they not tend to show how
much my time was occupied in doing other people’s
work, to the great hindrance of my own. A few more
instances of this, and I have done:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>August 24th.</i>—The Postmaster-General reports to the Treasury
that he cannot proceed with the arrangements for rural distribution
unless he has a map divided into registrars’ districts, or a description
of the boundaries of the districts. Why he should apply to the
Treasury to overcome the difficulty I know not (I wrote to Colonel
Maberly some time ago in reply to a remark of his, telling him that
there was no such map in existence). However, as I would rather
do the work myself than have the measure delayed, I have been to
the Registration Office, Poor Law Commission, and Tithe Commission,
to see if the necessary information for constructing a map
can be obtained. I have also sent for Arrowsmith to meet me
to-morrow morning, and hope by a little management to get the
thing done.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was done accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>With distractions so numerous and so various, with
a large amount of routine work, all requiring to be
dealt with carefully, with opposition at the Post Office
to almost every additional improvement that I proposed,
and with the greatest difficulty of obtaining
access to the ever-occupied Chancellor of the Exchequer,
without whose sanction no step, great or
small, could be taken, I found progress towards the
completion of my plan but slow; a slowness the more
galling because, meantime, not only general convenience,
but the fiscal results of the measure were
grievously suffering; while I feared that the public,
knowing that I was now in office, and yet ignorant
of the trammels under which I laboured, would—as
in fact a large portion of it did—charge upon the plan
itself failure really due to the incompleteness of its
development.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that I was stinted
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in such aid as
money could procure; for as early as February of this
year, having notified to him that I should require some
additional assistance, I was authorised to engage whatever
I might think necessary. Of course, the irremovable
pressure was from that kind of work which I
could not leave to others; and this more than once
seemed likely to bear me down:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, March 6th.</i>—I have been unwell this week, and have
done little more than carry on the current business. Lawrence,
whom I consulted to-day, has ordered leeches to be applied to my
neck, and desires I will get holiday if possible.</p>

<p>“<i>March 10th.</i>—Received from the Chancellor of the Exchequer
a very kind note, stating that Lawrence had written to him on my
case.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“He also sent for me and repeated his advice in the kindest and
most friendly manner, adding that he would undertake any cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
which could not wait my return. In the course of conversation I
expressed my regret, half in earnest half in joke, that I should have
added so much to his own labour by cutting down the Post Office
revenue so mercilessly. He replied that additional taxes would have
been necessary even if the postage had not been reduced, and that
the reduction made the imposition of such taxes much more easy.
He added that he thought the measure was working exceedingly
well, and begged that I would not be uneasy about it. I am to
take a fortnight’s holiday immediately, and more at Easter if
necessary.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Liberal Administration, which had been for
some time losing ground, showed, as the parliamentary
session advanced, increasing signs of weakness; the
falling revenue being, of course, one of its chief difficulties.
I could not but feel that for this I should
probably be regarded as in some degree answerable;
since the public could know little of the obstructions to
the fiscal success of my plan, and would, I feared, form
its conclusion by simply placing together the two facts,
that the postage had been lowered to a penny and the
net postal revenue fallen from £1,600,000 to £500,000.
More than ever did I regret that my proposals had not
been so taken up by the Government as to admit of
that gradual introduction of my plan which would have
prevented this loss. It must be remembered, however,
as was handsomely acknowledged by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, that the postal loss was by no means
the only one which the revenue had sustained; the
country being at that time under one of those depressions
which lessened the produce of all taxes of
whatever kind. In reviewing the whole matter calmly,
as I can do now, I feel also called upon to remember
that if, through excess of caution, the establishment of
penny postage had been delayed until such general
depression, combined, as it was, with other causes,
had thrown out the Liberal Government, the reform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
would, in all probability, have been deferred, at least,
until the return of the Liberals to power six years
later.</p>

<p>Be all this as it may, I felt anxious upon three
points. First, would the Tories, if they came into
office, attempt a reactionary course? Second, supposing
that they left the penny rate unchanged, would
they stop the progress of the other improvements
essential to the completion of my plan? And, third,
would they retain my services? I naturally clung to
the wish that I might be allowed to complete what I
sincerely believed to be a great improvement; the more
so as, with all the fond imagination of an inventor, I
already seemed dimly to foresee its universal adoption
producing universal benefit.</p>

<p>I resolved, at all events, to push forward improvement
as fast as I could, in order that the Government
which had given me my post might have whatever
credit such improvements might bring. One of the
most desirable measures was the extension of rural
distribution at home. Having ascertained by a
circular of inquiry that there were 400 registrars’
districts without a Post Office, I obtained sanction
for the establishment of a Post Office in each
of them, Lord Lichfield promising to push on the
arrangements immediately. By very great exertion
progress to this point was effected in little more than
a month; but how very long the measure, thus apparently
secured, had to wait before it was carried out
will appear hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the anomalies I found in the Post Office,
a striking one lay in the emoluments of the various
provincial postmasters, which, having been settled
on no rule, exhibited abundant irregularities. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
this I sought a remedy. To lay down a satisfactory
rule, however, required such information as was for
the time unattainable, through the almost total want
of systematic statistics in the Post Office. The
evil of such deficiency had lately been curiously
exemplified. In the year 1837, the postmasters
throughout the kingdom, being called on to report
the amount of their respective late letter fees, which
they then retained as a perquisite, had for the most
part rated it low, probably thinking it to their
interest that their emoluments should appear small;
but in the year 1840, when it was proposed to commute
such perquisite for a fixed allowance, the reports
then made showed, for the most part, an enormous
augmentation. Though doubtless many of these
returns were made fairly enough, yet the increase,
even on the average, was surprisingly large. Now it
was obvious that if the returns had been made as a
matter of course from year to year, when no change
was in prospect, such sudden exaggeration would have
been impracticable. I consequently proposed to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that there should henceforth
be a yearly return of all emoluments; and that,
as the Post Office appeared unwilling to undertake the
necessary collection and classification, the duty should
be added to my department. To this recommendation,
which was made as early as February, I received, at
the time, no decided answer; Mr. Baring, though
thinking the measure desirable, not rating the statistics
so highly as I did. I again brought the measure
before him, with several others, in the month of July,
anxious that all should be adopted before the change
then evidently approaching should take place; and
again obtained a general approbation of all I proposed,
without, however, any authority to proceed further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>Increase in the number of letters had, meanwhile,
proceeded satisfactorily:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Journal, February 2nd.</i>—The Chancellor of the Exchequer is
much pleased with the increase of letters, as shown by the comparison
of the present period with the corresponding weeks of 1840,
and wishes a form of return, exhibiting the results, to be prepared
for Parliament. Last night the number of letters and newspapers
was such, that with every exertion the mails could not be despatched
in time.”</p>

</div>

<p>I need not say that, throughout the whole period
which I am describing, I was anxiously alive to whatever
might indicate the probable course of events:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>February 9th.</i>—Herries has been moving for certain returns of
Post Office revenue, &amp;c., and the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells
me that he thinks the Tories, especially if they get into power, will
try to advance the rate to twopence. I told him that I did not
think they could succeed, at the same time reminding him that
I always was of opinion that twopence would produce the larger
revenue.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Baring held the opposite opinion, and I now
believe that he was right. A few months afterwards,
financial difficulties increasing, I was called on to estimate
the probable effect of raising the rate to twopence,
and my report, made, of course, after careful inquiry
and consideration, was not such as to induce Ministers
to try the change. To avoid recurring to the subject,
I may here add that once only was the question
revived. This was during the financial pressure
consequent on the Crimean war; when, being called
on to make a confidential report, I showed that,
though some immediate increase of revenue might
be expected from raising the rate to twopence, the
benefit would probably be more than counterbalanced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
in the long run, by the check to correspondence; and
upon this, the project was finally abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>As has been seen, however, the course of the Tories
was still uncertain:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>April 30th.</i>—The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought on his
Budget to-night. I was under the gallery. The Tories were aghast
at the Free Trade proposals, which occupied so much of their
attention, that they had little to say on the subject of postage.
Perhaps the returns, showing the steady increase of letters, may
have something to do with the matter. Sir Robert Peel was quite
silent on the subject; Goulburn talked some nonsense and made
some false [erroneous would have been a juster term] statements
with as much confidence as though he had understood what he was
talking about. He was answered by Hume.</p>

<p>“<i>May 12th.</i>—The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed an
apprehension that Sir Robert Peel would attempt to advance the
postage rate to twopence.</p>

<p>“<i>May 13th.</i>—Mr. Wallace called to say that he has no doubt
Ministers must resign, and that the Tories will attempt to advance
the postage—he says to threepence. Last night Mr. Patrick Chalmers
told me fourpence.</p>

<p>“<i>July 6th.</i>—He [the Chancellor of the Exchequer] still thinks it
probable that Peel will advance the rate.</p>

<p>“<i>August 27th.</i>—The Chancellor of the Exchequer tells me that
from what he observed in the course of his speech last night in the
House of Commons, when he spoke of the reduction in postage, he
is satisfied that Peel does not intend to raise the rate....
Cole reports that Mr. Moffatt has seen Lord Lowther, who tells him
that there is no danger of the Tories raising the postage-rate.”</p>

</div>

<p>From what has been said, it may be inferred that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
indications of the approaching change multiplied as
time went on; and it is scarcely necessary for me to
add that the dissolution to which the Government
resorted, when defeated in its Free Trade policy, resulted
in the election of a House by which it was
unseated. As the catastrophe approached my personal
anxiety naturally increased; a feeling readily understood
and kindly recognised by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 12th.</i>— ... This led to a conversation as to my
own position, in course of which Mr. Baring expressed himself very
strongly as to my zeal and skilful management, and said, that if the
period for renewing my engagement were come, he should certainly
propose to continue it, but that he could not, with justice to those
who might succeed the present Government, renew it now. He will,
however, record his opinion either in a minute or letter to myself
as to the manner in which I have discharged my duty. Nothing
could be more kind and friendly than his whole conduct, and I feel
much indebted for the open manner in which he spoke on so delicate
a subject as the present position of Government.</p>

<p>“<i>June 22nd.</i>—Applied for an interview with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, but could see him only for a moment, in the presence of
others.”</p>

</div>

<p>As matters were pressing, I wrote to him a letter in
which, after repeating the various reasons previously
urged for placing the administration of my plan
permanently in my own hands, I suggested for consideration
the expediency of taking advantage of
official changes then in progress to transfer Colonel
Maberly to some other post. The letter will be found
in the Appendix (J).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>July 6th.</i>—Had a long audience with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and nearly emptied my box of papers. This done,
he entered on the subject of my letter, and in the course of a very
friendly conversation spoke to the following effect. He was afraid
that there was no place vacant which could be offered to Colonel
Maberly. I mentioned the vacancy in the Poor Law Commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
He first said that he thought Colonel Maberly would not like the
appointment, but, on my pressing that he should be asked, Mr.
Baring intimated that it had been filled up; he admitted that it was
now desirable that I should be in the Post Office, and added nearly
as follows: ‘If there had been a vacancy in the secretaryship of the
Post Office when I first knew you I certainly should not have given
you the appointment, because experience has convinced me that
inventors are seldom men of business; but, having worked with you
for nearly two years, I have no hesitation in saying that if there were
now a vacancy I should propose to Lord Melbourne to give you the
appointment.’ I suggested that, as the surveyors are the agents by
whom improvements are carried into effect, perhaps the object in
view might be accomplished by making me Surveyor-General. He
promised to think of this, and, referring to our conversation of
May 12th, said, that as my engagement would terminate in about
two months, he should not hesitate in renewing it in some shape or
other.</p>

<p>“<i>August 20th.</i>—Spoke again to Mr. Baring on the subject of my
engagement. He stated that his intention was to renew it for a year
certain, and, on my proposing an indefinite renewal, said that if that
were done the question of salary must be reconsidered (in which I
acquiesced), and that he doubted whether he should be justified in
such a renewal. Finally, he promised to reconsider the matter, and
to show me the minute before anything was decided. I don’t think
this is quite just towards myself. My measure has been adopted by
Government; it has been tried under great disadvantages, owing to
the continuance at the Post Office of those who are hostile to it, and
still it has succeeded, and I have given entire satisfaction to Mr.
Baring, as he has repeatedly assured me; I think, therefore, that a
permanent position, either in the Post Office or the Treasury, should
be given to me. It is absurd to expect that the work will ever be
completed. Practically, there is no end to the improvements which
it is desirable to make, and I ought not to be exposed to the anxiety
resulting from the insecurity as regards my own income, in addition
to that which is inseparable from my position. I would rather suffer
some diminution of income and have the matter made permanent,
though, considering the labour, responsibility, and difficulty of my
duties, I don’t think I am overpaid.</p>

<p>“<i>August 27th.</i>—Was interrupted after a very short interview [with
the Chancellor of the Exchequer], and before I got through a tithe
of my business. Had no opportunity of speaking to him, as I intended,
on my own engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>August 28th.</i>—Waited in vain till late in the evening for an
interview with Mr. Baring. He has, however, promised to see me
on Monday. Division in the House of Commons last night on the
address (a majority of ninety-one against Ministers) makes an immediate
resignation necessary, and I am, of course, anxious not only
to settle my own engagement, but several Post Office references
which have been long in hand.</p>

<p>“<i>August 30th.</i>—Had a further conversation with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer as to my engagement. He now intends to write
me a letter on the subject, as he did when I was first engaged; but
I fear it will not be so decisive a renewal as I think it ought to be.
He appears to shrink from the responsibility of any decisive act now,
which, though very considerate towards his successors, is not, I
think, quite fair towards me. He is, however, quite friendly, and
promises to do all in his power. In the course of conversation he
said that I must expect hereafter a change in the tone of the Post
Office authorities; that from the very highest to the lowest they were
hostile to me and my plan, and that now he could no longer support
me such a change was probable. I think he expressed himself
somewhat more strongly than facts justify, but, in the main, I fear he
is correct, and if so, it is clear that the plan has been tried under
most unfavourable circumstances.</p>

<p>“<i>September 1st.</i>—I again spoke to Mr. Baring about my engagement.
He has not yet written the letter, but promises to do it
forthwith; the delay causes me much anxiety, and will, I fear, prevent
the possibility of obtaining any modification in the letter,
however desirable. Mr. Goulburn is to be the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, not Sir Robert Peel, as was expected. Mr. Baring
thinks this an advantageous arrangement for myself, as I shall have
a better chance of access to him. Report makes Lord Lowther
Postmaster General, an arrangement which would be very favourable
to my plan.”</p>

</div>

<p>I scarcely need say that the pleasing delusion into
which I thus fell was effectually dispelled in the course
of the following year:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>September 2nd.</i>—On arriving at the office I found the following
letter on my table:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“‘September 1, 1841.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—As it may be satisfactory to you to have in writing
the position in which I consider you to stand, I propose to put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
paper my view, in order that you may use it for the information of
my successor.</p>

<p>“‘I wish, therefore, to state that some time ago I informed you,
in reference to the Post Office business, that I thought it would be
of great advantage to continue your services beyond the two years
originally settled; that I did not deem it expedient to make any
engagement beyond one year, but that you might consider that for
one year from the expiration of the former two years your services
were engaged, on the same conditions as before.</p>

<p>“‘I think it but justice to you not to conclude this letter without
expressing to you my thanks for the unwearied and zealous assistance
which you have given me in the carrying on the Post Office business.
I feel satisfied that without that assistance it would have been
scarcely possible for the Treasury to have given any proper consideration
to the arrangements for putting the scheme into effect,
and I am happy in having to record my entire satisfaction with the
manner in which you have conducted the business of your office.</p>

<p>“‘You will make what use you please of this letter by showing it
to my successor.</p>

<p class="center">“‘Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="sign">“‘<span class="smcap">F. T. Baring</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“This is not what I could wish as regards the length of the
engagement, but I am satisfied that it is all Mr. Baring considers
himself justified in doing; and feeling that it would be very ungracious
to object to so kind a letter, I acknowledged it as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“‘Downing Street, September 2, 1841.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Pray accept my earnest thanks for your very kind
and gratifying letter, and for the just and able manner in which you
have carried my plan, so far, into effect.</p>

<p>“‘Looking forward with much anxiety, but in the hope that
happier times for all of us may yet be in store,</p>

<p class="center">“‘I have, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="sign">“‘<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>.’”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This must have been one of Mr. Baring’s latest
official acts, as the formal resignation of Ministers took
place on the following day; and though I had subsequently,
and, indeed, to the end of his life, much
pleasant intercourse with him, our official relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
here terminated. Of the important aid which he
afterwards gave me much remains to be said; but I
will here so far anticipate as to mention an incident
which occurred twenty-two years after this time.
Soon after my final retirement from the Post Office,
happening to be at Brighton, I met Sir Francis
Baring—for he had then succeeded to the Baronetcy—and
presently received a call from him. In conversation
with my wife he remarked that oftentimes, when
he worked with me at the Treasury, he had disagreed
with me in opinion, but had always found afterwards
that he was in the wrong and I was in the right.
Upon Lady Hill’s observing that she had been taught
by her husband to believe all Sir Francis Baring’s decisions
right, he replied, with a laugh, “Well, then,
now you have the very best authority for believing
them wrong.”</p>

<p>Three days after the date of Mr. Baring’s letter he
left Downing Street for the continent. About eleven
o’clock the same day Mr. Goulburn entered on the
business of his office. Twenty-seven years before
this time, when Bonaparte abdicated the throne of
France and withdrew to Elba, a caricature was said
to be privately circulated in Paris, representing an
eagle flying out from a window in the Tuileries, while
a fat goose waddled in at the door. Perhaps the
reader who has followed me through my labours and
anxieties, who has sympathized in my disappointments
and rejoiced in my success, and who remembers in
addition, that I had been all my life a Liberal, and
was by no means free from the prejudices of my
party, will pardon me when I confess that my mind,
at this crisis, harboured a feeling too much resembling
the scorn and bitterness which prompted the French
caricature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet had I, amidst all my troubles, some aids to
complacency. Of the approbation of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer I have already spoken, and certainly
this was my greatest comfort. The following tokens,
however, had their value. On the 8th of April, I
received a very beautiful silver salver from Liverpool,
accompanied with a letter from Mr. Egerton Smith,
Editor of the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i>, the leading journal
of that town, a gentleman who had from the first
been an earnest supporter of Penny Postage, and
who remained its steady advocate to the end of his
life. The letter informed me that the salver had been
purchased with the pence contributed by thousands of
his fellow-townsmen, and that Mr. Mayer, in whose
works the plate had been produced, and by whom it
was delivered into my hands, had waived all considerations
of profit, and worked <i>con amore</i>. On
July 2nd I received from Glasgow two highly-wrought
silver wine-coolers, bearing an inscription stating that
it was “in testimony of gratitude,” from a few
gentlemen of that city. I may here mention that
two years later I received a very pleasing testimonial
from Cupar, Fife, consisting of the works of Sir
Walter Scott, including the Memoir by Lockhart,—ninety-eight
volumes in all.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">NEW MASTERS. (1841-2.)</span></h3>

<p>On the day when Mr. Goulburn entered on the
duties of his office I wrote a note to him, enclosing
Mr. Baring’s letter, and requesting an interview at his
convenience. Meanwhile circumstances occurred to
raise my hopes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>September 6th.</i>—Called on Mr. Stephen [the late Right Hon. Sir
James Stephen, K.C.B.] at the Colonial Office on some postage
business. He assures me that I shall find Mr. Goulburn very
pleasant to transact business with—a man of high honour and of
great skill in <i>details</i>. Mr. [now Sir John] Lefevre, whom I afterwards
saw at the Board of Trade, gave a similar account of him.”</p>

</div>

<p>The first part of this favourable opinion was, in a
measure, confirmed the same day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This afternoon I had my first interview with Mr. Goulburn: he
received me with great civility, and inquired as to the nature of my
engagement, duties, &amp;c. He appeared somewhat at a loss to know
what I could have to do, and was not a little surprised when I told
him that seventy-two cases had been referred to me in the month of
August alone. He seemed to think that my plan was fully introduced,
and did not, as it appeared to me, learn with much satisfaction
that much remained to be done. We went through three or
four papers that were pressing, and he readily acquiesced in all my
recommendations. He is to consider whether the business hereafter
shall be conducted with himself or with one of the secretaries. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
inquired if he saw any objection to my communicating with Lord
Lowther; he replied, that he thought the more I conferred with
Lord Lowther the better.”</p>

</div>

<p>The next day’s record was also satisfactory:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>September 7th.</i>—Had my first interview with Sir George Clerk,
the new Secretary, and was received with great politeness.”</p>

</div>

<p>Presently, however, came passages of a somewhat
different character:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>September 13th.</i>—Called on Lord Lowther. Stated my own
desire, and that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that I should
communicate freely with him on postage matters. He did not
appear to me to meet the advance cordially; but it is said that he is
habitually cold, reserved, and cautious. He told me that, his patent
not being made out, he was not yet authorised to act, and appeared
to desire that I should understand that to be a reason for restricted
communication at present. I found that he had read my paper ‘on
the results of the plan,’ &amp;c., and the attack upon it, but he expressed
no opinion on either. Altogether, I do not consider the interview
very satisfactory.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a few days practical results of the change began
to appear. An application which I made to the Post
Office for needful information was declined, on the
alleged authority of the new Postmaster-General,
unless made according to forms which would have
made the actual slow progress intolerably slower; and,
at the same time, papers arriving at the Treasury from
the Post Office, which hitherto had been all handed
over to me, were now almost entirely withheld. On
the former point, however, matters were set right for
the time by a second interview with Lord Lowther,
who, I found, had acted in the belief that he was
merely continuing the previous practice, and who
appeared annoyed at having been misled. By his
authority I wrote a letter to Colonel Maberly, referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
alike to his lordship’s intentions, and to the
Treasury Minute in which my right for immediate
information was distinctly laid down. My letter, which
I wished to soften as much as possible, contained the
following passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let me add, that though clearly entitled to act as I have done,
I would at once have given up my claim and adopted the suggestion
contained in your note, if I were not convinced that to resort to
the formality of Treasury Minutes in the numerous instances in
which inquiry is necessary would seriously retard the progress of
business.”</p>

</div>

<p>The former order being thus re-established at the
Post Office, there remained to seek a similar restoration
at the Treasury. Here, however, Mr. (now
Sir Charles) Trevelyan (Assistant Secretary to the
Treasury) had kindly intervened on my behalf,
strongly recommending that the opportunity of checking
the Post Office expenditure should not be taken
from me, and had procured from Sir George Clerk a
promise to consult with Sir Robert Peel and Mr.
Goulburn on the subject. As no further result was
obtained, I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
suggesting that, in my present lack of employment, I
should either proceed with measures for the further
introduction of my plans, or that if this were at the
time impracticable, I should be allowed an interval of
entire repose after the heavy labours of the last two
years. This letter produced an immediate effect, Mr.
Trevelyan, Sir George Clerk, and even the Chancellor
of the Exchequer all speaking to me on the subject
in the course of the same day; explanations were
given, arrangements made (a kind of compromise
which I hoped would, in operation, gradually put all
things right), and the desired holiday most readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
granted. “Everything,” says my Journal, “was said
in the most polite and, to all appearance, friendly
manner, and altogether things have assumed a much
more favourable aspect.”</p>

<p>My term of holiday was certainly very little interrupted
with business, nor did I find more than three
or four papers awaiting me on my return a month
afterwards.</p>

<p>One intervening incident, however, I must not omit
to mention. The original conception of a uniform
penny rate has been more than once, of late years,
attributed to Mr. Wallace. How far that generous-hearted
man was from making such a claim himself
may be gathered from the following passage in a
speech delivered by him at Aberdeen, and reported in
the <i>Aberdeen Herald</i> of October 2nd:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And here let me say, once for all, that to Mr. Hill alone is the
country indebted for that scheme; for he is the real inventor, and its
only discoverer, while the honour conferred to-day upon me can only
apply to working it out in Parliament.”</p>

</div>

<p>The benefit derived from my holiday was not
checked by my first interview with the Chancellor of
the Exchequer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 5th.</i>—Got through much business with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer very satisfactorily.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nevertheless, the same interview ushered in what
afterwards proved a very serious matter. It was
indeed the beginning of the end; since the move then
first announced at length led, as I was informed, and
as I fully believe, to my being driven from office.
Before treating of this, however, it will be convenient
to deal with various other matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>The withdrawal of routine papers from my charge
having, of course, diminished my amount of work, it
was notified to me that my establishment should be
reduced, and it was suggested that Mr. Cole’s services
might be dispensed with. While admitting this on
the supposition that affairs remained on their present
footing:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I expressed an opinion (November 10th) that it would be better
to employ the whole strength of the establishment, and offered to go
into the Post Office to organize the registration of letters and superintend
the execution of the remaining parts of my plan, &amp;c.; all of
which he [Mr. Trevelyan] undertook to report to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, but intimated that his instructions were to reduce the
establishment, and talked of my doing with one clerk, to which I
decidedly objected.</p>

<p>“<i>November 11th.</i>—Mr. Trevelyan told me that the Chancellor of
the Exchequer had decided with regard to Cole (he leaves on
January 10th, at the end of his quarter); that he appeared well-inclined
as to my going into the Post Office, and would write to the
Postmaster-General on the subject.</p>

<p>“<i>January 8th, 1842.</i>—Cole leaves me to-day. The progress of
the Penny Postage both before and after its adoption by Government,
has been greatly promoted by his zeal and activity.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime, however, it had been ordered by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that all papers relative
to the Post Office, by whomsoever dealt with, should
afterwards be shown to me, in order that I might be
made fully aware of the course of proceeding.</p>

<p>Gradually I seemed to inspire some amount of
confidence:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>December 11th.</i>—This week I have had several difficult cases not
connected with penny postage, and I think I perceive, on the part of
Sir George Clerk, a tendency to rely more on me than heretofore.”</p>

</div>

<p>Similar entries appear on December 18th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
24th; but within two months the favourable aspect
changed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>February 12th, 1842.</i>—I have had three or four cases referred to
me this week, but by far the greater number, though certainly the
least difficult, are decided in the Treasury. This circumstance,
coupled with the total silence on the part of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer with regard to my recent letters to him, shows, I fear,
that no friendly feeling is entertained towards myself, and if so, towards
my plan.”</p>

</div>

<p>This impression was gradually confirmed by subsequent
events.</p>

<p>While support at the Treasury was thus feeble and
vacillating, I could have very small hope of aid from
the Post Office. It has indeed been seen that Lord
Lowther had withdrawn all objection to my calling
for returns as before; but these, though the information
I was able to extract from them was of use, were
in themselves a constant source of trouble from their
inaccuracy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 8th, 1842.</i>—Sent [to the Post Office] the financial returns
recently made to the Treasury, for correction. Ledingham cannot
convince —— that they are wrong (which they clearly are in principle),
and they are come back uncorrected. It is strange that men
whose sole duty it is to keep accounts should not only blunder, but
be unable to see the error when pointed out.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was in this account, I believe, but certainly in
one from the same functionary, that the balance
carried forward at the close of a quarter changed its
amount in the transit; and when I pointed out this
fact as conclusive against the correctness of the
account, it was urged that, without such modification,
the next quarter’s account could not be made to
balance! Errors, however, did not end here:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>May 20th, 1842.</i>—Received the Parliamentary Returns from the
Post Office. Very inaccurate. Sent Ledingham with them to the
Post Office to get them corrected.”</p>

</div>

<p>In short, it is literally true that an accurate return
or statement in detail of any kind from the Post
Office was at this time a rare exception.</p>

<p>If I had found it hard to make head previously
to the late change, I found progress now almost impracticable;
and, though I persevered in unremitting
effort, I had little, indeed, of that encouragement
which is derived from the prospect of speedy success.
For some time I had even considerable anxiety lest
much that had been done should be undone; but
these forebodings, at least, were not confirmed by the
event:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 7th, 1842.</i>—To-day’s <i>Morning Post</i> has a leader on the
subject of the financial measures to be brought forward by Sir
Robert Peel on Friday, from which the following is an extract:—‘It
is conjectured by some that Mr. Rowland Hill’s Penny Postage
inroad upon a revenue which could ill afford such an experiment, is
to be counteracted, not by the restoration of the old system, but by
an increase to the uniform rate of postage. The objections to this
are that it would not do much to supply the deficiency, and that it
would be an interference with an experiment deliberately adopted by
a former Parliament, and not yet acknowledged by advocates to have
failed in a financial point of view.’”</p>

</div>

<p>It is to be feared that to this very day the “advocates”
remain as obstinately unconvinced as ever:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 12th, 1842.</i>—Penny Postage is safe. Sir Robert Peel, in
announcing his financial measures last night, states that he does not
intend to advance the rate, at least at present. He speaks highly of
the social advantages of Penny Postage, and expresses an opinion
that the measure has not yet had a full trial. But he states, erroneously,
that the cost of the packet service defrayed by the Admiralty
exceeds the Post Office net revenue.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was, I believe, the first appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
statement which, in one form or other, has ever since
tended to perplex or mislead the public. More of
this hereafter.</p>

<p>Of my efforts for improvement during this year
of difficulties I propose to speak in less detail than
heretofore, limiting attention to a few matters of chief
importance. My labours were not altogether ineffectual,
though for the most part, as I have already said,
it was but seldom that I was able to accomplish anything
of much importance. To some extent the rule
already adopted with regard to new salaries and
additional emoluments must, I think, have acted to
check extravagance, even when control had passed
from my own hands; and I may add that an occurrence
about this time, due to past proceedings, showed
in a striking manner the value of the rule:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>June 11th, 1842.</i>—Week’s work chiefly a large number of salary
cases, <i>i.e.</i>, applications for advances, allowances, &amp;c., which have
been waiting ever since May, 1841, for returns ordered from the
Post Office. Many prove on investigation to be utterly groundless:
whether this explains the delay of twelve months in making the
returns (some, indeed, are not even yet sent in) I cannot say.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, my chief aim at this time, supposing the
penny rate to be secure, was to introduce measures for
increased facility, on which depended, in great degree,
the multiplication of letters, and for improved economy
to render such increase adequately beneficial to the
revenue.</p>

<p>It will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> that one of the last acts of
the late Chancellor of the Exchequer was to sanction a
plan for extending rural distribution. The necessity
for such a measure is shown in the following summary,
which I subsequently gave in evidence, the items of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
which, though literally correct, will scarcely be
credited in the present day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The establishment of rural Post Offices does not appear to have
been regulated by any well-defined principle. In some districts,
owing apparently to the greater activity of the surveyors, they are
exceedingly numerous; in others, of superior relative importance,
they are comparatively infrequent. Some places, of 200 or 300 inhabitants,
have them; others, with 2,000 or 3,000, are without.</p>

<p>“Of the 2,100 registrars’ districts, comprised in England and
Wales, about 400, containing a million and a-half of inhabitants,
have no Post Offices whatever. The average extent of these 400
districts is nearly twenty square miles each; the average population,
about 4,000. The average population of the chief place of the
district, about 1,400; and the average distance of such chief place
from the nearest Post Office, between four and five miles.</p>

<p>“Again, while we have seen that those districts which are altogether
without Post Offices contain, in the aggregate, a million and
a-half of inhabitants, it can scarcely be doubted that even those
districts which are removed from this class by having a Post Office
in some one or other of their towns or villages contain, in their
remaining places, a much larger population destitute of such convenience.
The amount of population thus seriously inconvenienced
the Post Office has declared itself unable to estimate; but it is probable
that in England and Wales alone it is not less than four
millions. The great extent of the deficiency is shown by the fact
that, while these two divisions of the empire contain about 11,000
parishes, their total number of Post Offices of all descriptions is only
about 2,000.</p>

<p>“In some places <i>quasi</i> Post Offices have been established by
carriers and others, whose charges add to the cost of a letter in some
instances as much as 6<i>d.</i> A penny for every mile from the Post
Office is a customary demand.”</p>

</div>

<p>By the plan sanctioned by Mr. Baring, an office was
to be established forthwith in every registrar’s district
where as yet none existed; my intention being to
propose such further extension from time to time, as
experience might justify. In my triumph at carrying
this measure through the Treasury before the change
of Ministers, I forgot to make due allowance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
the Post Office’s power of passive resistance; and
was, therefore, unprepared for a discovery which I
accidentally made four months later, viz., that Mr.
Baring’s minute on rural distribution had been
suspended by Mr. Goulburn. Of the reason for this
suspension I could never, so long as I remained in
office, get any information; but more will appear on
the subject hereafter.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the great and increasing expense
of railway conveyance. Convinced that there was
room for economy, I had directed a portion of my
attention to this department.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>September 10th, 1841.</i>—Completed a long minute on the subject
of a proposed day mail to Newcastle-on-Tyne, in the course of which
I have endeavoured to establish some principles with reference to
day mails, and to point out modes by which the cost of railway conveyance
in this and other similar cases might be greatly reduced.
Sent draft to Lieutenant Harness for his perusal.”</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot mention the name of Lieutenant (now
Colonel) Harness without adding that I always found
in him a very zealous and efficient co-operator. I owe
much to the information and assistance which he
yielded me from time to time.</p>

<p>The plan I proposed, which was upon the whole
more convenient for the public than the existing
arrangement, involved a saving of about £5,000 a
year, and it was with much satisfaction that five
months later I learnt that it had received the
approbation of the Postmaster-General. How I was
unexpectedly prevented from myself carrying this
important project into effect will be shown a few
pages later.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred which, however small in
itself, showed how far the Office was competent to
deal correctly with questions of economy. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Glasgow and Ayr Railway the practice had been to
place the bags under the care of the railway guard;
a service for which the company received £40 a year.
A Report came to the Treasury from the Postmaster-General,
showing that he had superseded this service
by the appointment of a mail guard, and taking credit
to himself for economy so effected by the discontinuance
of such payment; the self-gratulation being
made in the apparent forgetfulness that the mail
guard’s salary would be somewhere about double the
sum saved.</p>

<p>One form of extravagant expenditure on railway
conveyance was in occupation of superfluous space:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>August 2nd, 1842.</i>—In one instance, to which I have called
attention, namely, the day mail between York and Normanton, the
maximum weight of the bags being only two quarters twenty-four
pounds, two compartments of a second-class carriage are occupied
by the Post Office, that is to say, sixteen passengers are displaced to
make room for what is about equivalent to the luggage of one.
Recommended a thorough investigation of the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>In consequence of this discovery, the Post Office
was directed to report upon the state of all the railway
lines in respect of space occupied. The Report,
however, had not been received when my services
came to an end.</p>

<p>Another form of waste arose from inaccuracy as
to the length of railway used by the Post Office on
particular lines, the award, according to a common
practice, fixing not a gross sum, but a mileage rate;
thus, after much dunning for information, I found the
Post Office so overpaying one company by as much
as, £400 a year, though the true distance was stated
both in its official notices to the Company and in
its own time bills. What was more remarkable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
that the Post Office, after I had pointed out the error,
persisted in maintaining that the amount was correct.</p>

<p>My serious attention was also drawn to the Money-Order
Department, in relation to which I drew a long
minute, suggesting means for simplifying the accounts,
and thus effecting a great saving in the cost of
management. Sir George Clerk appeared to be
much struck with the facts of the case; but, considering
it too important for his decision, said he would
consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It so
happened that the necessity for decided measures
was demonstrated by the discovery of an alarming
fraud at a provincial office. The postmaster had
absconded owing the revenue more than £2,200, of
which only £1,000 was covered by sureties. It was
fortunate that his flight had not been taken a year
earlier, when his debt was much larger, varying from
£3,000 to £5,000. Even as it was, but for energetic
measures taken by the Post Office, the loss would
have been greater. I pointed out to Sir George
Clerk that about £250,000 appeared to be in the
hands of the several postmasters, and that other
losses must be expected. He concurred in this
view, and said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
would speak to the Postmaster-General on the subject.
Nevertheless my minute<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> was set aside, a mere
temporary arrangement being substituted.</p>

<p>It may be convenient to remark here that the
money-order accounts with the several postmasters,
which were then made up and transmitted to the
Central Office for audit but once a quarter, are now
made up and audited every day; and that no such
fraud, at least to any serious amount, has occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
since 1847, in which year I subjected the Money-Order
Office to a thorough revision.</p>

<p>In reference to the serious case reported above, I
have great pleasure in mentioning that the son of the
defaulter, moved only by filial obligation, eventually
made good the whole loss.</p>

<p>I return now to the notification made to me by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer on November 5th,
1841,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> a notification already spoken of as fraught
with serious consequences. He informed me that
the Postmaster-General had proposed to establish a
compulsory registration of money letters, with a
shilling fee to be charged to the receiver, when not
paid by the sender. I pointed out the impracticability
of the plan, and showed how the same end might be
obtained by unobjectionable means. It was arranged
that I should see the Postmaster-General, and prepare
a Report on the subject. Had my own plan of
registration been adopted, the complaints on which
the Postmaster-General’s recommendation was based
could scarcely have arisen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 8th, 1841.</i>—Saw Lord Lowther. He defends the
Post Office plan so earnestly that I suspect it must be his own. At
length, however, he partially admitted its defects, and listened rather
impatiently to mine [my plan, not my defects, which would perhaps
have had patient hearing]. Having an engagement, he requested me
to come again to-morrow. One thing surprised me much—he could
not see that an increase of lost letters, if only proportionate to the
increase of letters transmitted, argued no increase of risk.”</p>

</div>

<p>To illustrate this further, I will mention here that,
whereas the number of money letters passing through
the office had increased (according to Colonel Maberly)
by ten-fold, the number of missing money letters (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
shown by a Parliamentary Return obtained a few
months later) was no more than five and a-half-fold; so
that the risk in transmission, the only thing really in
question, had very sensibly diminished. This improvement
was the more remarkable, both because previously
to the establishment of Penny Postage the number of
such losses was in rapid increase, and because, as
already mentioned, the Post Office subsequently discontinued
a practice of gratuitously registering all
letters supposed to contain articles of value.</p>

<p>When I again called on Lord Lowther as requested,
I found him still decidedly averse to lowering the
registration fee, though otherwise half inclined to
adopt my plan. As he desired further information, I
undertook to send him my former Reports on the
subject, as also the draft Report then in preparation,
which I accordingly did. The draft, however, was
returned without acquiescence, and his lordship’s note
seemed to me to be written in no friendly spirit. In
consequence, I consulted with my brothers and other
friends.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 23rd, 1841.</i>—They all agree with me as to the necessity
of adopting decisive measures with a view of ascertaining whether
or not the further improvements which form important parts of my
plan are to be carried out fairly and speedily, and if not, that a
regard to my own reputation will require me to resign. Also that
the present is a case in which I should make a stand, without, however,
pushing matters to an extreme all at once.”</p>

</div>

<p>I accordingly sent in my Report,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> next day, to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, together with a letter,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
in which I offered my services, under the approval
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-General,
to carry the proposed measures into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
effect, undertaking the whole responsibility, and
guaranteeing that there should be neither a stoppage
of the mails nor any additional expense beyond the
amount of the additional fees.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 24th, 1841.</i>—Wrote also to the Postmaster-General,
expressing regret that I had not had the good fortune to satisfy him
as to the practicability of the measures which I had recommended,
and a hope that a proposal (viz., the above) with which I had accompanied
the Report would remove his objections.</p>

<p>“<i>November 25th, 1841.</i>—The Chancellor of the Exchequer has
read my Report, but apparently with little attention, for he is by no
means master of the subject; he seems to consider the plan objectionable,
but gives reasons for objecting to it which ought to
recommend it. Among others, that almost everybody would take
receipts, that is to say, that the gross revenue would be increased
nearly fifty per cent! He appears to think, with the Post Office
people, that the main object in view is to keep down the
quantity of business. My offer to undertake the registration had
evidently been overlooked. I called special attention to it, however,
and the whole matter is to be referred <i>privately</i> to the Postmaster-General.
I begged that it might be referred officially, in order that
the objections, if any, might be recorded, but this was over-ruled, at
least for the present.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Post Office bugbear of an overwhelming
number of registered letters, which was to produce
prodigious trouble and disorder at the “forward
offices,” I exposed in a supplementary Report.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>As gradually appeared, however, instead of pushing
forward an important improvement, I was only
strengthening Post Office hostility. My reports,
together with one subsequently received from the
Postmaster-General, were placed by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer in the hands of Mr. Trevelyan;
who sent for me on December 29th, 1841, to talk
over the matter. Unluckily, however, he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
read my reports, being deterred by their unavoidable
length, but called on me to give him their
pith. To make this summary more conclusive, I
proposed, first, to examine the report sent in by the
Postmaster-General; and at length, though Mr.
Trevelyan doubted Mr. Goulburn’s approbation, I
prevailed upon him, by the mere plea of justice, to
allow me to read it. I found, however, that while it
did not establish a single ground of objection to my
plan, it was written in a most hostile spirit, treating
my offer to undertake the necessary organization with
scorn; and absurdly representing it as one which
would supersede the authority of the Postmaster-General.
It was intimated, nevertheless, that the plan
itself would be carried into execution if required,
though it would lead to all sorts of evils; a prediction
which I knew it would be very easy for the Post
Office to fulfil. Mr. Trevelyan, after considering all
that I laid before him, told me that he agreed
entirely with me, and had advised Mr. Goulburn
accordingly.</p>

<p>Meantime, I had received some information from a
private source:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>January 18th, 1842.</i>—Mr. —— reports that Lord L. is very
apprehensive of attacks in Parliament for the no-progress hitherto
made, and uneasy as to the working of his registration scheme.
That in this state of mind he is inclined to rely more and more on
Maberly, a tendency which he, ——, thinks has been promoted by
the officials having persuaded him that the activity of the Merchants’
Committee, and the pressure from the public generally, is attributed
to myself. —— says Lord L. works very hard, getting up frequently
at six in the morning, but that his attention is given to small matters,
and that he constantly changes his objects. This account agrees so
well with the spirit manifested in Lord L.’s Report on registration
that I cannot doubt its accuracy. Unfortunately Lord L. is both
cold and suspicious, otherwise I would go to him and trust to the
effect of a plain, open and straightforward statement of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
case. With such a man as Mr. Baring such would be the true policy;
with Lord Lowther it would be useless, perhaps mischievous.</p>

<p>“<i>January 27th, 1842.</i>—Having prepared another letter to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, I sent it in this morning.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In this
letter I take no notice of the Postmaster-General’s Report, but
renew my offer to undertake the registration, and, in so doing, state
distinctly that I am ready to submit to the ‘<i>immediate</i>’ authority of
the Postmaster-General, so that there is no longer any pretence for
misunderstanding my intentions. I also enumerate several important
and urgent measures of Post Office improvement which have
occupied my attention while the question of registration has been
pending, and propose to submit the details for consideration if the
decision should be still further delayed. I think this letter will make
it very difficult for them to prevent the progress of the measure if
they are so disposed.”</p>

</div>

<p>My reason for entering into this detail on the subject
of registration was that, as already implied, it was my
proceedings on this subject which caused me the loss
of my post. I had, it appeared, crossed with my
advice a strong wish of the Postmaster-General’s.
This, as I was afterwards told, was never forgiven,
but became, more than any other single circumstance,
the ground of the demand which he is said to have
made soon afterwards for my dismissal. I have only
to add that, even when my opposition was set aside,
the course recommended by the Post Office was not
taken; the warner was dismissed, but the warning was
remembered; and though Lord Lowther remained
Postmaster-General as much as three years after my
removal, his plan of high-feed compulsory registration
was never carried into effect.</p>

<p>I should have felt my own post less assailable had the
Post Office revenue been more rapid in its recovery.
I have already referred to such depression as was
caused by increased Post Office expenditure, and by
those circumstances which at the time depressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the revenue in every department; and it must be
added that appearances were made worse by the
manner in which the accounts of the Post Office were
kept, the effect at this time being to reduce an actual
increase for the quarter, amounting to between £30,000
and £40,000, to an apparent decrease. Later, however,
the improvement began to be manifest:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>April 6th, 1842.</i>—The [Post Office] revenue accounts show an
increase of £90,000 on the year.... The Post Office revenue
is the only department ... which does not show a deficiency
on the quarter, a phenomenon which puzzles the Tory papers
amazingly.”</p>

</div>

<p>It had already been shown in the statement made
by Sir Robert Peel on March 12th, 1842, that a strong
disposition existed somewhere to make the loss resulting
from the adoption of penny postage appear as
large as possible, nor could I doubt as to the quarter
in which this disposition existed. Indeed, subsequent
events made everything clear. The inference which
it was intended that the public should draw from the
statement that the cost of the packet service exceeded
the whole Post Office revenue long served to mislead
that large portion of the public which, for want of
time or ability to examine, takes plausible appearances
for facts. The fallacy, nevertheless, was fully exposed
within two months of its first appearance. Lord
Monteagle, on June 21st, 1842, in a debate on the
Income Tax,<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When his noble friend (Lord Fitzgerald) adverted to the revenue
formerly derived from the Post Office, and stated that the whole of
the revenue had disappeared, his noble friend was labouring under a
very great mistake. The expense of the packet service, which was
said to swallow up the whole of the revenue now derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Post Office, had no more to do with the penny postage than the
expense of the war in Afghanistan or China. It was as distinct from
the Post Office as the expense of the army or navy.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a subsequent period, as will appear in its proper
place, I was called upon to expose the fallacy more in
detail; but everybody knows that an error once adopted
is slow of eradication. This particular one, gross as
it really is, is not only still to be met with here and
there among the public, but has actually been thrice
put forth, since my final withdrawal from office, in the
Annual Report of the Postmaster-General;<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> so that
even now it is far from superfluous to point out, that in
comparing the fiscal results of the new system with
those of the old, the cost of the packet service should
be excluded from the one as it was from the other.
Nor is it less necessary to urge that, whenever it is
deemed advisable to maintain a line of conveyance
for political purposes, or for any other purposes not
really postal, the expense, barring a due charge for
such postal service as may incidentally be performed,
should be charged, not to the Post Office, but to its
appropriate department; confusion of accounts being
always detrimental to economy and obstructive to
reform.</p>

<p>Naturally, I received, during this difficult period,
but limited support from without. The public,
satisfied with having obtained the adoption of the
penny rate, the reform in which it was most interested,
bestirred itself little in advocacy of those further improvements
in which its interest was less direct and
far less obvious; many persons, indeed, regarding
penny postage pure and simple as the be-all and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
end-all of the matter. Of course, I could no longer
communicate with the public, my mouth being
officially sealed; and I may observe here, that it
were well for the public to understand how completely
this is the case with all subordinate officers.
Whatever may be their views on the proceedings of
their department, whatever schemes they may form
or adopt for improvement, or, on the other hand,
whatever injustice may be done to them by their
official superiors, or whatever charges may be made
against them in Parliament, by the public press, or
otherwise—comment, or even statement of facts, is
forbidden by official rule; a rule, which being unknown
to the public, often leads to erroneous inference,
and encourages attacks which otherwise would
be regarded as cowardly.</p>

<p>From one more quarter, however, assistance was
given at this time. The Merchants’ Committee sent
in a memorial to the Treasury, signed by every one
of its members, Whig or Tory, urging the complete
execution of my plan, and followed up this step with a
deputation to the Postmaster-General, which ended in
their receiving an assurance that Lord Lowther was
desirous of carrying out my measures fully and fairly
“equally so with his predecessor.” Of the value of
the assurance the reader may easily judge by the
parallel.</p>

<p>The following was not a little encouraging:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>January 26th, 1842.</i>—Received a letter from Mr. George Stokes,
Hon. Secretary of the Parker Society (a Society of more than 4,000
members, the object of which is to reprint the works of the early
Reformers), stating that the very existence of the Society is owing to
penny postage.”</p>

</div>

<p>I must now trace the chain of circumstances which
more immediately preceded my dismissal, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
connection will in the outset be scarcely more visible
to the reader than it was, at the time, to myself.
I have already spoken of the letter which I had
addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the
day when he succeeded Mr. Baring in office. I have
also spoken of my attempts relative to registration, and
the offer of my services, subject to the Chancellor’s
approval, and that of the Postmaster-General, for the
organization, and, “till fully established,” the execution
of the measures proposed.</p>

<p>The letter in which this offer was made, and which
is dated November 24th, 1841, having received no
reply, was followed, on December 2nd, by a short
note, covering a further report on the same subject.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>On January 27th, 1842, no reply having yet been
received to either of these letters, I again wrote
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, urging that, if
registration could not be dealt with, I might be
allowed to proceed with some other part of my plan,
giving at the same time a list of measures out of which
one or more might be selected.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>This letter also obtaining no reply, I wrote again on
March 7th, mentioning other parts of my plan which
might be introduced pending the question of registration,
adverting to fresh evidence of their feasibility
and advantage, and again requesting that I might be
allowed to proceed in their introduction under the
authority of the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>I added the actual results thus far obtained, viz.,
that the chargeable letters annually delivered in the
United Kingdom had already increased from 75
millions to 208 millions, the increase in the London
district post letters being from about 13 to 23 millions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
that the illicit conveyance of letters was in effect suppressed;
that the gross revenue was about two-thirds
of the largest amount ever obtained, and nearly, if not
fully, as great as that under the fourpenny rate; that
the net revenue amounted to about £565,000, showing
an increase, notwithstanding many counteracting
causes, of £100,000 upon that for the first year of
penny postage; and lastly, that the inland, or penny
post letters, were decidedly the most profitable, if not
the only profitable, part of the Post Office business.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The letter concluded as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Looking to the progress now making, under the unfavourable
circumstances to which I have adverted, I see no reason to doubt
that, if the measure were fully and zealously carried into effect, a
very few years, with a revived trade, would suffice to realize the
expectations which I held out. I also firmly believe that those
circumstances which have tended in no inconsiderable degree to
diminish the utility of the measure ... may be avoided; and
that without any increase of expense, but simply by improved
arrangements.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“Let me hope, Sir, that I may not be considered as unreasonably
urgent in thus addressing you. Let me beg of you to consider with
indulgence the peculiarity of my position: that I have been appointed,
in the words of the Treasury minute, to ‘assist in carrying
into effect the penny postage;’ that, although I have no direct influence
over the arrangements, they are generally supposed by the
public to be under my control; that, my name being identified with
the plan, I am, to a great degree, regarded as responsible for its
success. On these grounds I confidently, but respectfully, appeal to
your kindness and justice to afford me the means of satisfying public
expectation by gradually carrying the plan into execution in its
fulness and integrity.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this letter I received, a fortnight afterwards, a
brief reply, if that can be called reply in which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
real answer is given, and no definite question even
touched upon.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>I subsequently wrote two other letters<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> (one on
March 23rd, and the other on May 31st) of the same
general tenour, but with every modification which I
could think of as likely to lead to the desired result.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
To neither of these did I ever receive any reply, so
that the short and evasive answer just mentioned was
the only notice ever taken of the various attempts
indicated in the foregoing letters to obtain attention
to the several improvements which I sought to introduce.
I have only to add that all the measures
then so slighted are now in operation, tending alike
to public convenience and to the increase of the
revenue.</p>

<p>Meantime, other circumstances were occurring which
before long brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>The proposed establishment of a day mail to Newcastle,
in accordance with my recommendation, having
rendered it desirable that I should visit that town, and
Mr. Hodgson Hinde, the Member for Newcastle,
having urged that my journey should be made without
delay, I applied to Sir George Clerk, and obtained his
ready acquiescence. Wishing at the same time to
visit some of the country offices, and scrupulously
desiring to avoid any approach to breach of rule, I
wrote to Colonel Maberly for authority so to do, but
this request being referred by him to the Postmaster-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
and representations being made by the latter
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the end was that
the sanction to my journey was altogether withdrawn,
the management of the matter being handed over to
the Post Office; with what prospect of good result I
leave the reader to judge. This, however, was not
all; for soon afterwards, viz., on July 12th, I received
a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not in
reply to any of mine, but announcing that from the
ensuing 14th of September (when my third year at the
Treasury would end) my “further assistance” would
be “dispensed with;” the notification, however, concluding
with the following acknowledgment:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In making this communication I gladly avail myself of the opportunity
of expressing my sense of the satisfactory manner in which,
during my tenure of office, you have discharged the several duties
which have been from time to time committed to you.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Being very unwell at the time when this letter
reached me, and of course far from benefited by its
perusal, I was constrained to apply to Sir George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Clerk for a short leave of absence—a request readily
granted. After a little repose I prepared an answer
to Mr. Goulburn’s letter, which, after much reconsideration
and consultation with my brothers, I sent
in on July 29th. Its general purpose was to urge
that the late decision might be reconsidered; but,
to ease matters, I offered, as I had done on a
previous occasion, to work for a time without salary.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Meanwhile, however, additional discouragement had
occurred from the fact that, in reply to an objection
raised against my salary by Colonel Sibthorpe, the
intended discontinuance of my services had been
announced by Sir George Clerk in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>On August 1st I received a note from Mr. Moffatt,
of which the following is an extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘I perused with great concern the flagrant announcement made in
the House on Friday evening touching the rejection of your future
services.</p>

<p>“‘Memory supplies me with no parallel to this treatment; it embodies
an act of public dishonesty, which, if permitted, would be
alike discreditable to the Government which proposed, and to the
assembly which should sanction, such an arrangement.’</p>

<p>“<i>August 9th.</i>—Matthew has taken up the matter earnestly; he has
seen Brougham, Wilde, Villiers, and Aglionby, who express great
anger and surprise now they understand what is intended. It seems
they had assumed that I was to be employed in some other department;
this, they say, is the general impression, which accounts for
the apathy on the subject hitherto. Some course or other will, I
expect, be decided on to-morrow. Of course I take no part in the
matter myself.”</p>

</div>

<p>After much consultation, however, it was deemed
expedient to defer all action until the next session of
Parliament; and, though the announcement of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
decision was little to my satisfaction, I kept my
thoughts to myself.</p>

<p>About a week afterwards I received a letter from
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply to my letter
of July 29th, which, however, though it spoke in somewhat
elaborate approbation of my services, repeated
his decision as to their discontinuance.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>“<i>August 20th.</i>—I want to make the remnant of time as effective
as possible, and with this view generally get to work soon after six in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“<i>September 10th.</i>—Received an unexpected summons from the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.... He was very cordial and
friendly, and began to express his regret at the necessity under which
he felt himself as to the termination of my engagement, &amp;c. I told
him that I did not intend to avail myself of the interview to reopen
the question, and merely wished to thank him for his intention of
recording in a Treasury Minute approval of my services.... He
intimated the probability of his applying to me hereafter for special
assistance in Post Office affairs, if I had no objection; thanked me
earnestly for what I had done, and shook hands with apparent
warmth. His manner now and heretofore, and the tenour of his
letters, go far to confirm the impression that he feels that he is
acting unjustly, and under compulsion, I believe, of the Postmaster-General,
who is said to command five or six votes in the House of
Commons.”</p>

<p>“<i>September 14th.</i>—My engagement terminates to-day.... The
revenue payments for the quarter up to the 10th instant amount
to £112,000; or £33,000 more than at the corresponding date of
last year.</p>

<p>“<i>September 17th.</i>—On a review of this Journal I find that the
savings which I have effected or proposed since the present Government
came in (September 3rd, 1841) amount at a low estimate to
£80,000 per annum, of which £51,000 is the amount since I
received notice of the termination of my engagement. And these
savings are in no instance obtained by a sacrifice of convenience on
the part of the public, but in many [instances] are the result of
measures tending greatly to increase such convenience.</p>

<p>“<i>September 22nd.</i>—Lord Brougham, who has seen a copy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
correspondence between Mr. Goulburn and myself, pronounces my
case to be ‘irresistible.’ He has kindly volunteered to write to Lord
Ashburton, who is daily expected to return from America, to get him
to see Sir Robert Peel on the subject.... Sir Thomas Wilde,
who had previously seen the same correspondence, also expresses a
strong opinion as to the strength of my case, and has very kindly
volunteered to undertake it in Parliament. A strong case in such
hands will indeed, I trust, prove irresistible.</p>

<p>“<i>September 23rd.</i>—Many of the Liberal papers are attacking the
Government on account of my dismissal.</p>

<p>“<i>September 26th.</i>—Yesterday and to-day prepared, with Matthew’s
assistance, a letter to Sir Robert Peel, stating shortly the leading
facts of my case, tendering proofs of each part, and earnestly begging
an audience.</p>

<p>“<i>September 28th.</i>—Sent in my letter to Sir Robert Peel (dated
yesterday).<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Sent also a copy, with a short note dated to-day, to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>“Received from the Treasury a letter (27th inst.) passing my
accounts and containing the following paragraph:—‘I am also commanded
by their Lordships to take this opportunity of stating that
they consider it due to you, on the termination of your engagement
with the Government, to express to you the approbation with which
they have regarded your zealous exertions in the execution of the
duties which have been entrusted to you, and how materially the
efficiency of the Post Office arrangements has been promoted by the
care and intelligence evinced by you in the consideration of the
various important questions which have been referred to you.’</p>

<p>“<i>October 12th.</i>—Dined with Mr. Moffatt at the Reform Club.
Showed him the recent correspondence with Goulburn and Peel, and
discussed with him confidentially future proceedings. He is very
much in earnest, and desirous of assisting, through the Committee,
as much as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Three days later I received the following letter from
Sir Robert Peel:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Drayton Manor, October 13th, 1842.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
the 27th of September. It reached me the day after I had left
London.</p>

<p>“Had I received it previously to my departure, I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
acceded to your request for a personal interview, though I consider
the subject of your letter fitter for written than for verbal communication.</p>

<p>“Since I received it I have referred to the letter which you
addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 29th of July
last, and to the Minutes of the Board of Treasury respecting your
appointment, and have given to the subject generally the best consideration
in my power. It had indeed been brought under my
notice by Mr. Goulburn, at the time that his letters of the 11th of
July and of the 11th of August were addressed to you.</p>

<p>“I am bound to state to you that I entirely concur in the opinion
expressed by Mr. Goulburn in that of the 11th of August, that the
continued employment of an independent officer, for the purposes
for which it is urged by you, would necessarily lead either to the
entire supercession of those who are by their offices responsible for
the management of the Post Office department, or to a conflict of
authority, highly prejudicial to the public service.</p>

<p>“I entertain a due sense of the motives by which your conduct in
respect to Post Office arrangements has been actuated, and of the
zeal and fidelity with which you have discharged the duties committed
to you; I cannot doubt that there are still important<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
improvements in those arrangements to be effected, but I must
presume that they can be effected through the intervention of the
regularly-constituted and the responsible authority, namely, the
Postmaster-General, acting under the superintendence and control
of the Board of Treasury.</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Robert Peel</span>.</p>

<p>“Rowland Hill, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>My dismissal, therefore, was now complete and
absolute. My right to complete my own plan was
denied, all opportunity for so doing withheld, and the
measure was to be handed over to men who had
opposed it stage by stage, whose reputation was
pledged to its failure, and who had unquestionably
been caballing to obtain my expulsion from office.
Of the feeling under which Mr. Goulburn acted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
this matter I have already given my opinion; indeed,
I had now become fully aware that the responsibility
of the act did not rest on him. As regards Sir
Robert Peel, with whom the decision of course lay,
to suppose that the reasons which he gave were those
which constituted his real ground of action, or that
he could have considered his letter as any valid
answer to mine, would be an imputation on his
understanding which I shall not venture to make.
By whatever necessity he may have been constrained,
I cannot but think that as he wrote he must have
felt some little of that painful feeling which unquestionably
pressed hard upon him in more than one
important passage of his political career.</p>

<p>The following reply closes the correspondence:—<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Bayswater, October 18th, 1842.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 13th instant, confirming the decision of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</p>

<p>“In closing this painful correspondence with the Treasury, permit
me, Sir, to make one observation with the hope of removing from
your mind the impression that I sought to be reinstated in an office
which must impede the public service by introducing a conflict of
powers in the administration of the Post Office. I would beg
respectfully to recall to your recollection that the Post Office is not
only under the general control of the Treasury, but acts with regard
to matters of importance under its immediate and specific directions;
and that my suggestions, being addressed to the superior authority,
could not create any collision between the Post Office and myself.
When they were rejected by the Treasury, I always submitted, as it
was my duty to do, with implicit deference. When, on the other
hand, they were adopted, they became, of course, the orders of the
Board, to which the authorities of the Post Office were equally
bound to defer. This arrangement, which is, I submit, in exact
conformity with the long-established practice defining the subordinate
functions of the Post Office, was the one directed by the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
my appointment; and as long as such an arrangement is faithfully
observed or duly enforced, it would appear that no danger can exist
of the evil arising to which reference is made.</p>

<p>“But even if these objections were valid against the particular
office in question, you will, I am sure, do me the justice to remember
that, in my letter to yourself, as well as in those to Mr. Goulburn
which form part of this correspondence, I have expressed my readiness
to accept any situation in which my services could be effective
to the establishment of my plan.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, I beg leave to express my thanks for the kind
regard to my feelings which dictated those expressions of approbation
with which you, in common with Mr. Goulburn, have been
pleased to acknowledge my humble services. They afford me, I
respectfully assure you, no slight consolation under the sense of
injustice which at this moment weighs upon my mind. You are not
unacquainted, Sir, with the long and severe labour which I had to
undergo before my plan was adopted by the country and sanctioned
by Parliament. When I was called upon to assist in carrying the
measure into execution, the Government stipulated that I should
apply my whole time to this duty, exclusive of all other occupations.
It is quite true that the part of the agreement relating to salary was
made certain for a limited period only; but as the purpose of my
engagement was the performance of a specific task, I little thought
that limitation open to a construction which precludes me from
fulfilling my undertaking, more especially when the question was
relieved from all embarrassment on the score of salary. If I could
have imagined that I should be dismissed before my plan was fully
developed in action, whatever time might be found to be really
necessary for that object, I should have been little justified in entering
upon the task. The ultimate advantage which was to accrue to
me was not of a pecuniary nature. It was believed, and rightly
believed, that I aspired to the reputation which might fairly be expected
to attend the conduct of so great a measure to its completion,
and that with such a result of my exertions I should be well satisfied.
Deprived of that conduct, I am deprived of the means of earning
my only reward.</p>

<p>All being thus decided, and my last duty performed,
I saw no reason to delay any longer that
relaxation of which I now stood much in need, and
during the next month the entries in my Journal
are comparatively few. While I was resting my
friends were at work:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 9th, 1842.</i>—Matthew informs me that Lord Brougham
had a long conversation with Sir James Graham, on the 7th instant,
on the subject of my treatment, in the course of which he (Lord B.)
told Sir James Graham that in his opinion the Government was
making a great practical mistake, and intimated that I must of
course defend myself, and that he, from his long acquaintance with
myself and opinion of the plan, should feel bound to take up the
cudgels on my behalf in the House of Lords. That Sir James
Graham appeared also to think that a mistake had been made, and
promised to speak to some other members of the Cabinet on the
subject. Lord Brougham subsequently wrote to Sir James Graham
a letter to be laid before Peel.”</p>

</div>

<p>To give to the public such a knowledge of facts
as would enable it to do justice either to my plan or
myself, it was obviously important to publish that
correspondence with the Treasury in which I had
again and again urged improvement, and in which
my application had been as often either neglected or
evaded; in which, also, I had received notice of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
dismissal, had deprecated this step, and had been
informed of persistence in the intention, with such
show of reason as had been vouchsafed me. Being
aware, however, that such publication was likely to
be the subject of attack, I was careful, before venturing
on it, to ascertain my right to make it; and
this I knew must depend upon precedent and require
reference to authority:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 26th.</i>—Matthew applied to Earl Spencer<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> for his
opinion.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following is his lordship’s letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Longford, November 25th, 1842.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—As the correspondence you sent me looked rather
alarming as to bulk, I delayed reading it till I had the opportunity
of a journey. I took this opportunity yesterday.</p>

<p>“I can see no public grounds why your brother should not publish
it if he thinks fit. As a question of personal prudence I think the
thing more doubtful, but I think your letter only goes to his <i>right</i> to
publish it. I have no business, therefore, to say anything more than
that I think he has a right to publish it.</p>

<p>“You know, however, that I sometimes have done more than
answer a question put to me simply, and I will do so now by
adding to my answer that if I was in his place I would not
publish it....</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 29th.</i>—To-day the Merchants’ Committee [which had
applied for an interview early in August] has seen Sir Robert Peel.
They strongly urged the necessity for completing the measure—their
want of confidence in the Post Office—their confidence in me, and
the great satisfaction it would be to the public to see me restored to
office. Peel satisfied the deputation that he was sincerely desirous
of carrying out the measure, and Goulburn, who was present,
assured them that, whatever might have been the feeling originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
entertained by the Post Office, all there were now earnest friends of
the measure! (It did not occur to the Committee to inquire where,
then, lay the danger of ‘collision.’) Peel invited the Committee to
send in a statement of those parts of the plan which they still wished
to see carried into effect; but he stated that a return from the Post
Office showed that, <i>with the exception of about £100,000 per annum,
the net revenue was obtained from foreign and colonial letters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> This
statement, which he made in an early stage of the conversation,
threw the Committee quite aback; for though I had prepared them,
as I thought, to distrust all information derived from the Post
Office, their want of familiarity with the subject, and the confident
manner with which the statement was made, caused them to
believe it.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Committee at my suggestion subsequently
applied for a copy of this return, but it was prudently
withheld; and, with equal prudence, no reason was
assigned for the refusal. Of this return, however,
more will appear by-and-by. Meantime, the question
of publishing the correspondence remaining still undecided,
I sought further advice. On December 4th
I received the following letter from Mr. Baring:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Brighton, Dec. 3rd, 1842.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I hope to be at Lee on Tuesday, and shall be at your
service on Wednesday morning. But if you are not afraid of a bad
dinner, which you probably will get the first day of our return, you
had better come down on Tuesday, dine and sleep at Lee, and we
will talk over the matter on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">F. T. Baring</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>After careful perusal and reperusal of the correspondence,
Mr. Baring, in the course of several conversations,
pronounced my line of conduct very
judicious, and the conduct of Government very
shabby. He said it was absurd to expect that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Post Office would satisfactorily carry into effect the
remaining parts of my plan, and that consequently my
dismissal was most unfair towards the measure. He
added that, even without reference to my plan, my
retention as a permanent officer would be useful as a
check upon the proceedings of the Post Office; and
that such retention would be in conformity with the
system of Treasury management, which consists in
having an officer to check each subordinate department.
He assured me that it was never his intention
that my services should cease as a matter of course at
the expiration of the year mentioned in his last letter,
the fair interpretation of which was that he considered
it advantageous to continue my services indefinitely,
but that as he was then leaving office, and as there
were rumours of an intention on the part of the next
Government to abandon my plan, he did not feel
justified in giving me a claim for more than one year’s
salary. These opinions he would be prepared to state
in Parliament. He thought it probable that Lord
Lowther’s jealousy was the cause of the mischief, and
that that jealousy was excited by my opposition to
his plan of registration, which, he remarked, if carried
into effect would have created an uproar throughout
the country. He was of opinion that I had a right
to publish the correspondence, but feared that by so
doing I should bar the door against other employment,
to which he regarded me as having a claim,
that otherwise would probably be recognised even by
the Government then in power; so that he was rather
averse to my taking any step before the meeting of
Parliament. I replied that, although I, of course,
should be glad to obtain other employment under
Government, my chief anxiety was to satisfy the
public that I had not misled them by holding out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
expectations which could not be realized, and that,
although I would carefully consider his kind advice,
my present inclination was to sacrifice all other considerations
to the accomplishment of this object; on
which he remarked that, if I were not satisfied with
the discussion in Parliament, I could still publish the
correspondence. He expressed an opinion that it
would not be practicable to bring before Parliament
copies of my Reports, or those of the Post Office, to
the Treasury, inasmuch as such Reports being considered
confidential, the rule is to refuse their production.
This was a serious disappointment, as I had
depended mainly on the publication of these Reports
as a means of showing the manner in which my duties
had been discharged, and the nature of the opposition
of the Post Office.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Same day.</i>—Matthew has seen Lord Spencer. His view coincides
almost exactly with Mr. Baring’s, differing only (if I have
understood Mr. B. rightly) in thinking that the late, as well as the
present, Government would disapprove of any appeal to the public,
except through Parliament.”</p>

</div>

<p>As Mr. Warburton concurred in disapproving immediate
publication, I yielded to the advice of so many
influential friends, though my own opinion was still
strongly in favour of the prompter course. Meanwhile
there came in from various members of Parliament
and many other friends letters of sympathy and
support; among others, the following kind and
characteristic one from Mr. Cobden:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Newcastle-on-Tyne, 20th January, 1843.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—The men of the League are your devoted servants
in every way that can be useful to you. Colonel Thompson, Bright,
and I, have <i>blessed you</i> not a few times in the course of our agitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
tour.... I go back to Manchester to-morrow, after a very
gratifying tour in Scotland. ‘The heather’s on fire.’</p>

<p>“Believe me,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">R. Cobden</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">R. Hill</span>, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was followed, within a week, by a second
letter, in which it will be seen that the warmth of
his feelings led him into very strong expressions.
These I do not suppress, as every one can make for
them the allowance due to time, circumstance, and a
generous nature:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Manchester, 26th January, 1843.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—I have read over the correspondence, and, so far as
success in placing the Government in the wrong goes, you will be pronounced
triumphant by all who will read it. But nothing is more
true than the remark in your brother’s excellent letter, that the force
of public opinion cannot be brought to bear upon the authorities to
compel them to work out details. So far as your object in that
direction is concerned, your correspondence will, I suspect, be
nugatory. If your object be to justify yourself in the eyes of the
public, <i>that</i>, I submit, is supererogatory. You cannot stand better
than you do with the impartial British public. You will get no
further facilities from Tory functionaries. They hate the whole
thing <i>with a diabolical hatred</i>. And well they may. It is a terrible
engine for upsetting monopoly and corruption: witness our League
operations, the <i>spawn of your penny postage</i>! Now, let me deal
frankly and concisely with you. I want to see you remunerated for
the work you have done. The labourer is worthy of his hire. The
country is in your debt. An organized plan is alone necessary to
insure you a national subscription of a sum of money sufficient to
reimburse you for time, trouble, and annoyance incurred and expended
in your great social revolution.... A public subscription—a
really national one—would give you power and
independence, and when the next change of Government takes
place you would be in the ascendant. Until then I expect no hearty
co-operation in carrying out your details. We must be content, in
the meantime, to prevent the Tories from robbing us of any substantial
part of the principle, and I think we have bulldogs enough
in the House now to prevent that. I should like to have some talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
with you about this matter. Meantime, excuse my plainness, and
don’t suspect me of wishing to make you a <i>sordid</i> patriot. You see
what an effect the £50,000 League Fund is producing: a similar
demonstration in favour of the author of Postage Reform, and a
seat in Parliament in prospective, would have a like effect upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>Very different, but no less characteristic of the
writer, is the following letter, received some months
later, from Thomas Hood:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“17, Elm Tree Road, St. John’s Wood,<br />

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“I have seen so many instances of folly and ingratitude
similar to those you have met with, that it would never surprise me
to hear of the railway people some day, finding their trains running
on so well, proposing to discharge the engines.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">R. Hill</span>, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, I felt nowise daunted by late events,
but rather filled with fresh zeal; for although I never
willingly entered into a conflict, yet when one was
forced upon me, or stood between me and what I
deemed right, I was by no means backward at the
work.</p>

<p>One of my earliest moves after leaving office was
towards personal and domestic economy. While I
was in receipt of a large salary, and had my attention
fully occupied, and indeed my powers heavily taxed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
I had allowed my expenditure to obtain dimensions
unsuitable to my present condition. Of course I
intended to seek new occupation, but this would
require time; and, meanwhile, I felt that if I would
act independently I must make myself independent
of circumstances. I therefore entered at once upon
a course of vigorous retrenchment, and partly by
my efforts, but much more by the zealous and most
efficient co-operation of my dear wife, our expenditure
was soon brought within very narrow limits. Without
any change of house or diminution in number of
servants, our disbursements were soon reduced by
one-half, and it was only in the first year after the
change that my expenditure exceeded my income.
I may add that it never had exceeded it before, and
that it never exceeded it again.</p>

<p>As the parliamentary session approached, however,
I had to turn my attention more and more to the work
of preparation for the duty which I expected it to
bring. I therefore put my papers in the most perfect
order—a proceeding which has greatly facilitated the
writing of this part of my narrative.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wilde having very kindly undertaken
to lay my case before Parliament, I could not but feel
some anxiety as to the view that might be taken
of this course by Mr. Wallace, who had himself
acted as leader in earlier days. I therefore wrote to
him on the subject as delicately as I could, and a
fortnight afterwards, when he came to town for the
parliamentary session, I called upon him with some
feeling of anxiety. I quote from my Journal:—</p>

<p>“He behaves nobly, as he always has done, fully acquiescing in
the arrangement with regard to Sir Thomas Wilde, and expressing
his own readiness to follow Sir Thomas’s lead.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, my attention was called to
considerations of a somewhat different character:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>February 8th.</i>—Met Mr. Stephen, of the Colonial Office, in
Piccadilly, and at his request walked with him to the Colonial
Office. On the way he urged me to apply to the Government
for employment, saying that he felt sure my claim would be
acknowledged—intimating that I might expect such an appointment
as a Commissionership of Customs. I replied, that such
a step would be considered as a tacit engagement on my part
not to bring my case before the public; that other friends
had recommended a similar course, under the impression that
the complimentary expressions in the letters from the Treasury
were intended by Government to suggest it, but that, after
mature deliberation, I had decided not to do anything which
should prevent my making known to the public the true
causes of the small amount of revenue actually obtained, as
compared with my anticipations, and justifying my conduct
throughout. Mr. Stephen rejoined that he did not doubt I
might stipulate to do all this, providing that I refrained from
attacking the Government, and yet obtain lucrative and honourable
employment. To this I said I of course could not
object, and he recommended that two of the leading merchants
or bankers in the city, of opposite politics, should make
the application on my behalf. I promised to consider the
suggestion, but requested that he would, in the meantime,
read the correspondence, a copy of which I sent him the same
afternoon.</p>

<p>“<i>February 11th.</i>—Prepared a memorandum ... called
on Mr. Stephen, read it to him, and left it with him; he
expressing a desire to reconsider the matter, with a view,
perhaps, of making such inquiries of Goulburn, with whom
he is intimate, as would enable him to judge of the probable
success of such an application as he had suggested. I
desired that he would do whatever he thought best, clearly
understanding, however, that I was no party to anything of the
kind.</p>

<p>“<i>February 15th.</i>—Mr. Stephen writes that he has ascertained that
nothing can be done unless I submit to be gagged, and not very
much even then; so the whole ends in smoke.</p>

<p>“<i>Same day.</i>—Wrote to Mr. Stephen thanking him for his kindness,
which, from the very unreserved manner in which he spoke of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Government, I feel very strongly; but of course declining to apply
to Government.”<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

</div>

<p>About three weeks later, Mr. Goulburn, in reply
to an application made by Mr. Hutt, on behalf of
Sir Thomas Wilde, for the production of my correspondence
with the Treasury, refused to give more
than a few letters, withholding those of chief importance;<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
and though, on being pressed, he somewhat
enlarged the grant, it still remained very
imperfect. Unsatisfactory, however, as was this concession,
motion was made accordingly:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 29th.</i>—My correspondence with the Treasury. The
printed copies were delivered this morning. By the omission of
all the letters urging progress in the plan, Goulburn’s notice of
dismissal is brought into juxtaposition with a minute of December
24th, 1841 (of which I never heard till now), confirming the extension
of my engagement for one year from September 14th, 1841, and
made to appear as the natural sequence of such minute, instead of
being, as it was in fact, the answer to my complaints of no progress,
and of Post Office interference to prevent my journey to Newcastle.
The whole thing is cunningly done, and it shows that the five weeks
taken to prepare the correspondence have not been lost. The case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
is so much damaged, however, that I have determined to give the
papers a very limited circulation, and to press on Wilde to consent
to the publication of the whole. Sir Robert Peel, in his letter<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> to
me, admits that ‘important improvements’ still remain to be
effected; but in the printed copy the word ‘important’ is dropped.”<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To my surprise, the strength of my case, grievously
impaired as it was by this maiming of the correspondence,
was nevertheless recognised in one of the
journals regularly supporting the Government:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March 30th.</i>—The <i>Morning Herald</i> gives the correspondence
with Sir Robert Peel, and has a leader, sneering, of course, at penny
postage, but expressing an opinion that I have been unjustly treated,
and ought to have a place or a pension.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is the last entry in my Journal for the present.
On the one hand, I became so engrossed in preparation
for the coming conflict—a conflict which seemed
to me as one almost of life and death—that I had no
time to spare save for pressing demands; while, on
the other hand, the motive to record was greatly
weakened since my exclusion from the Treasury. For
the history of the following three years and a-half, my
dependence is on documents, parliamentary or otherwise,
produced during the period (all of which I have
carefully preserved), and on such recollections as are
suggested by their perusal.</p>

<p>On April 10th a petition for inquiring into the
state of the Post Office, prepared by myself and in
my own name, was presented to the House of Commons
by Mr. Baring; and on the following night
Mr. Hawes gave notice that Sir Thomas Wilde
would call the attention of the House to the same
soon after the Easter holidays—a notice, however,
which from various causes had to be repeated several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
times before being acted upon. Of this petition, which
appears at length in the Report of the Committee,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
I will merely mention here that, after reference to my
appointment and subsequent dismissal, after statements
as to the very incomplete introduction of my plan,
evidence as to the hopelessness of its completion being
effected by the Post Office, and representations as to
the vast interests at stake, I concluded by expressing
my desire “to submit the truth of the foregoing allegations
to the severest scrutiny,” and by petitioning
for the necessary inquiry.</p>

<p>This petition was presently backed by another from
eight members<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> of the Mercantile Committee, so often
mentioned before, in which, after briefly adverting to
the beneficial effect of the improvement already made,
the petitioners, expressing an earnest desire for the
completion of the plan, prayed for inquiry with a view
to that end.</p>

<p>I now felt that the time was come when my friends
should be put in full possession of the facts of the
case; and, consequently, having printed all of the
correspondence which had been applied for in Parliament,
that withheld as well as that granted, I sent
copies, marked “strictly confidential,” to the members
of the Mercantile Committee, and some others of my
friends, prefacing it with an introduction, in which I
justified the proceeding—first, by the declaration of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that his denial was
made on the ground that the part which had been
withheld was unnecessary, no allegation being made as
to inconvenience to the public service, and, secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
by the high authority which I had for saying that I
had a right, looking to the nature of the correspondence
itself, to official usage, and all other
circumstances, to place the whole before the public.
This step, taken on April 13th, was on the 19th
condemned in the House of Commons by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Mr. Goulburn, but defended
by the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Baring.</p>

<p>It was not until May 1st that I obtained a copy of
the return upon which Sir Robert Peel, in the preceding
November, based his injurious and erroneous
statement that the inland post yielded but £100,000
a-year to the revenue. This return was now laid
before Parliament on the motion of Sir George Clerk.
In consequence I addressed a letter to the daily papers,
in which I expressed myself as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have no hesitation in stating that the return, whether considered
in regard to its general results or to the division of revenue
under the two heads, is utterly fallacious.”</p>

</div>

<p>I concluded by promising to give in due time a
full exposure of the fallacy—a promise afterwards
fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In the short period during which this return was
under my consideration, an incident occurred which
must be mentioned, because, besides giving additional
evidence of Post Office incompetency, it excited some
surprise and not a little amusement. The Overland
Route to India being now established, a notice was
issued by the Post Office, that persons wishing to
send letters by that route to Australia must address
them to “an agent in India,” who in turn must pay the
postage onward, as otherwise the letters would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
forwarded. To the unreasonableness of expecting that
every one writing by that route to Australia should
have an agent planted half-way, was added such
vagueness of expression as would have rendered the
injunction very misleading; “India” being put for
“Bombay,” where alone, according to Post Office
arrangement, the postage could be paid. The
absurdity of the proceeding was so manifest that
within a week from its appearance the notice was
withdrawn.</p>

<p>In this short period, also, Mr. Ashurst, acting for
the Mercantile Committee, issued a circular to mayors
of towns and other representative persons, recommending
that petitions should be sent up praying
for the complete execution of my plan; the recommendation
being accompanied with a statement showing,
in the most pithy manner, the chief estimates
as to number of letters and average of postage
under the old rates, made severally by the Post
Office authorities, the Parliamentary Committee, and
myself, previously to the adoption of the plan, and
comparing them with actual results.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Baring had moved for a return,
to show how far the instructions, issued by the
Treasury more than a year and a-half ago,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> for the
extension of rural distribution, had been carried into
effect by the Post Office. Of course he had, ere this,
learnt from me that its operation had been suspended
by the Treasury; but now, in the return called for,
this essential fact was suppressed, the whole answer
being as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No definite arrangements have yet been made by the Post Office
in conformity with the Minutes of the Lords of the Treasury, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
the 13th and 27th days of August, 1841, relating to the Post Office
distribution in the rural districts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">W. L. Maberly</span>.</p>

<p>“General Post Office, 8th April, 1843.”</p>

</div>

<p>The motion, so important to me, and, as I thought,
and still think, to the cause of postal reform, seemed
in danger of lapsing to the end of the session, not
coming on until June 27th. The House was far from
full, but the number present was considerable. I
obtained a seat for myself and my brother Arthur
under the gallery, sitting on the opposition side of
the House, that I might the more readily supply my
friends with any information that might be required
during the progress of the debate. Colonel Maberly,
likewise under the gallery, was, I suppose for the like
reason, on the Government side of the House. The
debate occupies forty-seven pages in “Hansard;”<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
but keen as was the interest with which my brother
and I listened to every word, I shall not trouble the
reader of the present day with more than a brief
abstract.</p>

<p>The motion of which Sir Thomas Wilde had given
notice was for a Select Committee, “To inquire into
the progress which had been made in carrying into
effect the recommendations of Mr. Rowland Hill for
Post Office improvement; and whether the further
carrying into effect of such recommendations or any of
them will be beneficial to the country.”<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wilde, after adverting to the deliberate
adoption of my plan by Parliament, and this in a time
of commercial depression, with the knowledge that its
adoption was expected to produce a small permanent
and a large immediate reduction of revenue, pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
out that my plan had been presented as a whole, no
part being recommended unless accompanied with the
remainder. After referring to the authoritative condemnation
of the old system, to my appointment, to the
acknowledged value of my services, to the opposition
of the Post Office, to the hopelessness of expecting the
completion of my plan from that department, or even
from the Treasury, unless aided by one able and ready
to deal with the fallacies with which resistance was
defended; after having pointed out the unfairness of
the experiment on which my plan had been judged,
and, in fine, given a history of the progress (and non-progress)
of postal reform during the time I was at
the Treasury, and of my dismissal therefrom, he concluded
by moving the resolution of which he had
given notice.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while repeating
some of the allegations made in his letter to me,
endeavoured to inculpate the late Government, and
to throw upon them the responsibility of my dismissal,
condemned my divulging the correspondence as a
breach of confidence, greatly overstated the power
committed to me during his tenure of office, spoke
of much having been accomplished since I left the
Treasury, enumerating for this purpose some measures
adopted on my recommendation while I was still
there, and others hastily resolved on since the presentation
of my petition, no one of which, however,
was yet carried into execution.</p>

<p>He attempted to defend the opposition to the reduction
of the registration-fee by greatly overstating
the amount of money-order business, extolled Lord
Lowther, absurdly attributing to him the origination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
of penny postage,<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> though he had voted against it in
committee;<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> asserted that the Post Office did not pay
its own expenses;<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> but ended by saying that he had
no objection to a limited inquiry, and by proposing,
as an amendment to Sir Thomas Wilde’s motion, the
following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the measures
adopted for the general introduction of the system of penny
postage, and for the facilitating the conveyance of letters throughout
the country.”<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. F. Baring (late Chancellor of the Exchequer)
saw no objection to the amendment, and hoped that
Sir Thomas Wilde would allow it to be carried in lieu
of his own motion. He touched upon the unfair use
made of the term “penny postage,” a term by no
means including the whole plan, for the purpose of
limiting my engagement; and remarked that in renewing
this engagement for one year he had not
meant to restrict it to that period, but had merely
refrained from acting discourteously towards his
successor, while “all along of opinion that the services
of Mr. Hill at the Treasury would be required for a
much longer period than one year.”<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> He continued
as follows (and I hope that I may be pardoned for
making the quotation):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He also thought it was only common justice to say that, at the
period when it was determined to carry out this plan, he had not the
slightest personal knowledge of Mr. Rowland Hill.... He had
expected that a person who had been long engaged in the preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
of an extensive system of this kind would not carry out the
change with that coolness and judgment that was requisite; and he
had expected that he should have great difficulties to contend with
in inducing Mr. Hill to adopt any alteration in his plan that might
appear requisite. He found quite the contrary of this, and that Mr.
Hill, with the greatest readiness, adopted any suggestions that were
made to him; so that instead of difficulties, he found every facility
in carrying the plan into effect. True, Mr. Hill gave his reasons for
the opinion that he had adopted, or for the course that he recommended;
but if any of his suggestions were not adopted, he always
found Mr. Hill most ready to give way to the course which he
suggested.”<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He admitted that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No absolute bargain had been broken with Mr. Rowland Hill,
still he could not help expressing his sincere regret that, after three
years’ exertions, which were characterized by the utmost zeal and
intelligence, he should be allowed to retire from the public service
in the way in which he had. He repeated that, although no bargain
had been broken, still, if zeal, intelligence, and ability, and the
rendering important public services, entitled any one to claim consideration,
Mr. Hill had a most powerful case.”<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Towards the close of his speech he dealt as follows
with Mr. Goulburn’s statement as to the extent of the
money-order operations:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The calculation which the right hon. gentleman had made, as to
the amount of money transmitted through the Money-Order Office,
was a most extraordinary one. The right hon. gentleman stated the
amount to be eight millions, whereas he should have said four
millions; the right hon. gentleman had made the slight mistake of
doubling the amount by calculating the money which was paid in, and
adding to it the same money when paid out. According to the right
hon. gentleman’s mode of calculating, to arrive at the quantity of
water which passes through a pipe, you must add the water which
enters at one end to the same water when it passes out at the
other end, and the quantity so added together will give the result
desired.”<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>He rejoiced that a Committee was to be appointed,
and he observed, in conclusion:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That if ever there was a measure in reference to which the
people had a right to ascertain whether it was carried into effect
fully and fairly, it was this.”<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Robert Peel—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Had never felt a doubt as to the great social advantages of
lowering the duty on letters; the only doubt was as to its financial
effect: in all other respects the result of any inquiry would show
that, whatever might have been the loss to the revenue, much advantage
had been derived in what concerned the encouragement of
industry, and the promotion of communication between the humbler
classes of the community.”</p>

</div>

<p>After observing that “it was, therefore, no dissatisfaction
with Mr. Hill’s conduct, no indifference to his
services, that led him and his right hon. friend to take
the course they had taken,”<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> he said, in reference to
my original appointment—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appeared to him that, had it been deemed necessary to retain
Mr. Hill’s services, and had it been conceived that the Post Office
authorities were hostile to the plan, prejudiced against its principle
and its details, and indisposed to lend themselves with zeal and
cordiality to carrying it out, the plan should have been, not to retain
Mr. Hill in control over the Post Office (yet unconnected with it),
but to have at once made him Secretary of the Post Office.
That department would thus have been no longer in a position
continually to obstruct, as the complaint was, the due execution of
the plan; but Mr. Hill himself, the person so deeply anxious for the
success of the scheme, would have the immediate control of it.”<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He also spoke of Colonel Maberly in terms of
general esteem, and denied that he had failed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
cordial co-operation with me, speaking likewise in
high terms of Lord Lowther, and maintaining (contrary
to fact) that he had voted in committee for all
Mr. Warburton’s resolutions,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and was a decided
friend to Mr. Hill’s system.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He acquiesced in the
appointment of a Committee, and “would assure them
(the House) that, while he continued in office, he
would lend all his weight, influence, and authority
to insure full justice to the new system.”<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wilde declared himself satisfied with the
amendment, which was agreed to without a division.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The indirect effect of the modification demanded by
Ministers in Sir Thomas Wilde’s motion was to take
the nomination of the Committee out of the hands
of the mover, and to give it to Government—the
natural consequence being that the majority was made
to consist of Government supporters. Of the thirteen
gentlemen selected, six only were of the Liberal
party; amongst these, however, were some of my best
friends. Of course, in securing a majority, Government
also obtained the appointment of the Chairman,
and the choice fell upon Sir George Clerk. Upon
this choice no further comment can be required than
a simple statement of the position. I had appealed
against a decision of the Treasury, a Court was constituted
to try the case, and of this Court the Secretary
of the Treasury was President. Lord Brougham used
to tell of an amusing occurrence, I think at York, at
the time when he was on the Northern Circuit.
When the list of the jury was calling over, preparatory
to trying a certain case, the judge, remarking identity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
of name between one of the jurors and the plaintiff in
the suit, and inquiring, “I suppose, Mr. Thomson,
you are no relation to the plaintiff in this cause?” was
answered, “Please you, my Lord, I <i>is</i> the plaintiff.”
The interloper was of course discharged, and a severe
rebuke was given to the officer of the court by whom
so improper a selection had been made. Looking at
my own case, however, the parallel would have been
more complete had he been retained, and made, at
least, foreman of the jury. However, to have obtained
a Committee at all was a very great gain; for though
the bias to be naturally expected from its composition
did not fail to show itself in the course of the proceedings,
still opportunity was thus given for that full
and plain statement of facts which, I felt sure, would
suffice to set me right with the public; and, in justice
to the Committee generally, I must say that my opportunity
for making such statements was fairly given.
I had, indeed, some browbeating to endure (even
beyond what appears in the Report, as may be seen by
the letter given below),<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> but with this the Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
generally did not appear to sympathize; indeed, I
have reason to believe that it tended rather to injure
than to benefit the cause which it was meant to
advance.</p>

<p>Although a member of the Astronomical Society for more than
half a century, and, with the exception of two out of about 430,
the oldest now living, I have never contributed to the Society’s
transactions.</p>

<p>Yet from boyhood I have been very much attached to astronomical
pursuits. My father was well informed on the subject, and
eventually, though several years later than myself, became a member
of the Society.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> He had long possessed a reflecting telescope,
capable of showing Jupiter’s Moons and Belts, and Saturn’s Rings,
though not, according to my recollection, any of the moons, even
the rings appearing not severally but as one. He had also a
Hadley’s Quadrant, an artificial horizon, and a tolerably good clock,
and he regularly took in the “Nautical Almanac.”</p>

<p>By means of this simple apparatus, he not only regulated the
clock, but determined the latitude and even the longitude of our
house, or rather of the playground, at Hill Top.</p>

<p>In these occupations I was invariably his assistant; and it was in
this manner and with the aid of his lectures that I gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
acquired, even while a boy, a taste for Astronomy, and, for my age,
no inconsiderable knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>My father (like myself in youth and early manhood) was a great
walker, and we frequently journeyed together. When I was only
nine years of age, I walked with him, for the most part after dark,
from Birmingham to Stourbridge, a distance of twelve miles, with
occasional lifts—no doubt according to usage—on his back. I
recollect that it was a brilliant starlight night, and the names of the
constellations and of the brighter single stars, their apparent motions
and the distinction between the so-called fixed stars and planets,
formed then, as on many other similar occasions, never-failing
subjects of interesting conversation, and to me of instruction. On
the way we passed by the side of a small pool, and, the air being
still, the surface of the water gave a perfect reflection of the stars.
I have a vivid recollection, after an interval of nearly seventy years,
of the fear with which I looked into what appeared to me a vast
abyss, and of my clinging to my father to protect me from falling
into it.</p>

<p>The remarkable comet of 1811—remarkable from the length of
time it continued in sight—interested me greatly. I was then fifteen
years of age. I examined it frequently with our telescope, got much
information from my father and from such books as were accessible
to me; and before the comet had disappeared was, I believe,
tolerably familiar with what was then known of cometary astronomy.</p>

<p>As already stated in the “Prefatory Memoir,” the teaching of a
subject was with me concurrent, or nearly so, with the learning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
soon began to lecture on Astronomy, first to the boys of our school,
and afterwards to a literary and scientific association of which I was
a member.</p>

<p>With a view to these lectures, availing myself of the “Transactions
of the Royal Society” (taken in by one of the Birmingham libraries
to which we subscribed), I read, I believe without exception, all the
contributions of Sir William Herschel, then incomparably the first of
living English astronomers. My reverence for the man led me to
contrive, on the occasion of my second visit to London (1815), to
go round by Slough, in order that I might obtain a glimpse—as the
coach passed—of his great telescope, which I knew could be seen
over the tops of the neighbouring buildings.</p>

<p>In the “Prefatory Memoir” I have already spoken of my teaching
navigation, of the planispheres which I constructed for my father’s
lectures upon electricity, of my trigonometrical survey, of my visit to
Captain Kater and the Greenwich Observatory, and of my Vernier
pendulums—all more or less intimately connected with my pursuit
of Astronomy. Nor must I omit mention of a popular explanation
of the transit of Mercury in May, 1832, which I wrote for the
“Penny Magazine.” (See Vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 82.)</p>

<p>I may also mention, as a fact worth recording, that in 1817 (I
believe) the celebrated mathematician, M. Biot, passed through
Birmingham on his return from the Shetland Isles, where he had
been engaged in measuring an arc of the meridian.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> My father was
invited to dine with him, I think at the house of Mr. Tertius Galton;
and afterwards both he and I, among others, were invited to meet
him at the rooms of the Philosophical Institution. Very few obeyed
this second summons, perhaps because the day fixed upon was
Sunday. He showed us in action a small instrument for the
polarization of light—a subject of which my father and I, and I
think the others, were up to that time profoundly ignorant. The
only individual with whom M. Biot appeared to be previously
acquainted was an emigré, Dr. De Lys, a leading physician of
Birmingham, whose father, the Marquis De Lys, had been guillotined
during the Reign of Terror. In the evening we met again at a
coach office in the Market Place, to bid farewell to M. Biot on his
departure for London, when he caused some tittering, and put poor
Dr. De Lys to the blush by publicly kissing him, in French fashion,
on both cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the Astronomical Society. My attendance at its
meetings, so long as I continued to live near Birmingham, was
necessarily rare. On my removal to the neighbourhood of London
it became more frequent, but even then my time was so fully
occupied with more pressing duties that my attendance remained
very irregular, and it totally ceased several years ago. I have,
however, invariably read the “Monthly Notices” of the Society’s
proceedings, and have thus benefited more, perhaps, than by mere
attendance.</p>

<p>Still, as already stated, I have never contributed to the Society’s
transactions, the truth being that up to the time of my becoming
disabled for steady application to any difficult subject, my mind
was so entirely engrossed with my official duties, that the little
leisure I could obtain was necessarily devoted to recruiting my
health.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as already shown,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> I have attempted something to
promote my favourite science. The following is an instance of the
kind:—</p>

<p class="center">VARIABLE STARS.</p>

<p>On the 16th January, 1865, I addressed the following letter to my
late excellent friend, Admiral Smyth:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Admiral</span>,—I have just completed the perusal of your
very interesting volume on ‘The Colours of Double Stars,’ kindly
presented to me by Dr. Lee in your name and his; and I thank you
for the gratification it has afforded me.</p>

<p>“What you say on the subject of variable stars has called to my
recollection an idea which first occurred to me shortly after the
discovery of the periodicity of the increase and decrease in the
number and frequency of solar spots. I am aware that such increase
and decrease is not continuous, and that the variation is not such as
materially to affect the Sun’s brightness. Still, in point of fact, is
not our own Sun a variable star—however slightly—with a period,
tolerably well defined, of about eleven years? And may not the
more marked character of other variable stars be owing to similar
causes to those which produce the spots in our sun, acting with
greater regularity and intensity?</p>

<p>“If you think it deserving attention, pray favour me with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
opinion of my theory. Possibly it may have been suggested
previously, but if so, I am not aware of the fact.</p>

<p class="center">“I remain, my dear Admiral, yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>.</p>

<p>“Admiral Smyth, F.R.S., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards I received a very friendly letter from Mrs.
Smyth, the tenor of which will be sufficiently understood from
what follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Hampstead, 20th January, 1865.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Smyth</span>,—Many thanks for your letter. Pray don’t
let the Admiral withdraw himself from his present work. My theory
can wait, or I may find an opportunity of consulting some other
authority.</p>

<p>“Our kindest regards.</p>

<p class="center">“Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="sign">“<span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>I accordingly, on the 14th February following, addressed a letter—similar
to the one to Admiral Smyth—to my friend, Mr. Warren
De La Rue, then President—as Admiral Smyth had once been—of
the Astronomical Society; but although Mr. De La Rue took
much trouble to ascertain whether my theory had, as he thought,
been suggested before, it was not till long afterwards that he was
able to give any definite information on the subject.</p>

<p>In a letter of July 9th, 1866, Mr. De La Rue drew my attention
to a paper by Mr. Balfour Stewart in the Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, which, in the opinion of Mr. De La Rue,
“gives a very explicit enunciation” of the theory.</p>

<p>On referring to the paper in question (Vol. <span class="smcapuc">XXIII</span>, part iii.), I found
that it was read on the 18th April, 1864, and the following is an
extract from a memorandum which I made on the subject:—“Indirectly,
by showing a probable connexion between the maxima
and minima of Sun-spots and the rotation of Jupiter about the
Sun, and by suggesting that the periodic variations of the stars
is caused by the rotation of large planets about them, Mr. Balfour
Stewart has, I think, forestalled me.” Perhaps, however, I may be
justified in doubting whether the enunciation here given is very
explicit.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, it is necessary to digress for a moment. When
a boy I was fond of reading books of elementary science. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
occasionally met with statements which puzzled me—which appeared
to me to be wrong—but assuming, as children do, the infallibility
of the author—or perhaps I should say of a printed book—I
naturally came to the conclusion that my own understanding was
in fault, and became greatly disheartened. After awhile—I forget
on what occasion—I applied for solution of the puzzle to my
father, who, possessing a large amount of general information, was
well qualified to advise. To my great delight, he assured me that
I was right and the author wrong. My unqualified faith in printed
statements was now, of course, at an end; and a habit was gradually
formed of mentally criticising almost everything I read—a habit
which, however useful in early life, is, as I have found in old age,
a cause of much waste of thinking power when the amount is so
reduced as to render economy of essential importance.</p>

<p>Still, through the greater part of my life this habit of reading
critically, combined as it was with the power of rapid calculation,
has been of great use to me, especially in my contests with the
Post Office, and, after I had joined the Department, in the revision
of the thousands of Reports, Returns, and Minutes prepared by
other officers.</p>

<p>In general literature, if the author attempt to deal with science,
the chance of a blunder appears to be great. Even Lord Macaulay
could not always do so with safety, as appears from the following
passage:—“In America the Spanish territories [in 1698] spread
from the equator northward and southward <i>through all the signs
of the Zodiac</i> far into the temperate zone.”<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> What can be the
meaning of the words which I have marked for Italics?</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant, too, whose admirable stories I never miss reading,
says, in one of her latest, “there was a new moon making her way
<i>upwards</i> in the pale sky.”<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>There is no writer to whom I feel more grateful than to Miss
Edgeworth. When a boy I read her delightful stories with the
greatest possible interest, and I feel sure that they had considerable
influence in the formation of my character. Unfortunately, however,
they are frequently disfigured by scientific errors. Thus, in
her admirable story of “The Good Aunt,” the following passage
occurs: “My dearest Aunt,” cried he [Charles], stopping her hand,
as she was giving her diamond ear-rings to Mr. Carat—“stay, my
dearest aunt, one instant, till I have seen whether this is a good
day for selling diamonds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, my dear young gentleman, no day in the Jewish calendar
more proper for de purchase,” said the Jew.</p>

<p>“For the purchase! yes,” said Charles, “but for the sale?”</p>

<p>“My love,” said his aunt, “surely you are not so foolish as to
think there are lucky and unlucky days.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean anything about lucky and unlucky days,” said
Charles, running up to consult the barometer; “but what I mean
is not foolish indeed; in some book I’ve read that the dealers in
diamonds buy them when the air is light, and sell them when it
is heavy, if they can, because their scales are so nice that they
vary with the change in the atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Now, as the metallic weights are of greater specific gravity than
the diamonds, the interests of the dealers—so far as they are
affected by change of atmosphere—must be to buy when the air
is <i>heavy</i> and sell when it is <i>light</i>. An increase of density in the
air would, of course, reduce the gravity of both diamonds and
weights, but not equally: the diamonds, being the more bulky,
would lose gravity more than the weights, and consequently would
weigh less. If it were possible that the air should increase in
density till it became as heavy, bulk for bulk, as the diamonds,
they would float therein, or, in other words, weigh nothing at all.</p>

<p>I well remember when, as a boy, I first read this admirable story,
how much I was puzzled by the mistake in question.</p>

<p>An error, occasionally met with in novels, is as follows. A wonderful
marksman has to exhibit his powers, which he does thus:—He
throws into the air two birds—or perhaps inanimate objects—as
two apples; then, <i>waiting till both are in a line with himself</i>,
sends his arrow or bullet through both. A slight consideration
will show that, in a vast majority of cases, no amount of waiting
would suffice.</p>

<p>Another prevailing error is, that a person simply standing by the
side of a pool can see his own reflection from the surface—Narcissus
must have found some support which enabled him to lean over the
fountain.</p>

<p>But it is in books especially intended to teach elementary science
that such errors are most to be regretted.</p>

<p>A few years since I purchased for some of my grandchildren the
eighth edition of “The Seasons,” by Mrs. Marcet. It is an
admirable work, highly interesting and useful; but before placing
it in the hands of my grandchildren, I thought it necessary to read
it myself—a very pleasing task, by-the-by—and to correct any
errors I might find. As examples, I may mention that in Volume I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
snow is described as frozen rain; that in Volume IV. <i>both</i> stones
in a flour-mill are said to revolve; and that the description in the
same volume of a marine steam engine is very incorrect.</p>

<p>Again, few books are better calculated to interest boys than
Dr. Parris’s “Philosophy in Sport,” but when, in the year 1829,
I bought a copy for the School-Library at Bruce Castle, I found
it necessary, before placing it there, to make numerous corrections
to which I drew the attention of the author, who, in a letter dated
March 18th, 1829, still in my possession, thanks me for my communication,
and admits some of the errors, though not all.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the admitted errors, I give the following:—“Mr.
Seymour now informed his young pupils that he had an
experiment to exhibit, which would further illustrate, in a very
pleasing manner, the truth of the doctrine of <i>vis inertiæ</i>. He
accordingly inverted a wine-glass, and placed a shilling on its foot;
and having pushed it suddenly along the table, <i>the coin flew off
towards the operator, or in a direction opposite to that in which the
glass was moving</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>My correction is as follows: “The coin would fall nearly in a
perpendicular direction, but inclined a little <i>towards</i> the direction
in which the glass was moving, owing to the friction between the
glass and coin.”</p>

<p>As a specimen of the non-admitted errors, I give the following:
“He had ignorantly fired a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen gases
in a tin vessel; the consequence of the combustion was the immediate
formation of a <i>vacuum</i>; and what happened? Why, the
pressure of the external air, not being any longer balanced by
elastic matter in the interior of the apparatus, crushed it with
violence, as any other enormous weight might have done; and so
ended the accident, which report magnified into a most awful
catastrophe.”<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>My correction is as follows: “The first effect of the combustion
was to <i>expand</i> the air in the vessel, and this <i>expansion</i> it was that
caused the accident.”</p>

<p>On which the author, after quoting my correction, replies, “Now
you will allow me to say that here you have fallen into an error;
I am perfectly correct in saying that the accident arose from the
external pressure of the atmosphere; for remember that the vessel
contained a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases, which, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
combustion, immediately combined and formed water, leaving an
almost perfect vacuum in the interior.”</p>

<p>If any one entertain a doubt as to which of us is correct, I would
suggest his filling a small bladder with the proper mixture of oxygen
and hydrogen, and exploding it by electrical means; as I did nearly
sixty years ago. The bladder will be destroyed; but, according to
Dr. Parris’s view, it should simply collapse.</p>

<p>But even men of unquestionable scientific knowledge are not
always correct. The late Professor Phillips, in his able and interesting
Address as President of the British Association in 1865,
after noticing Foucault’s recent admeasurement of the velocity of
light, proceeded as follows:—“By this experiment the velocity of
light appears to be less, sensibly less, than was previously admitted;
and this conclusion is of the highest interest. For, as by assuming
too long a radius for the orbit of Jupiter, the calculated rate of light-movement
was too great; so now, by employing the more exact
rate and the same measures of time, we can correct the estimated
distance of Jupiter and all the other planets from the Sun.”<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Professor Phillips’s great forte was geology, not astronomy. To
any one familiar with the means by which Römer determined the
velocity of light, it is unnecessary to point out that, although his
observations were made on the satellites of Jupiter, the radius of
Jupiter’s orbit has nothing to do with the problem. The only
material facts are, first, the <i>difference</i> between the maximum and
minimum distance of Jupiter from the earth,—that is to say (disregarding
eccentricity) the diameter of the earth’s orbit; and,
secondly, the effect which this varying distance has on the times
at which the eclipses apparently take place. This effect Römer
found to extend to about 16 minutes—and he thence concluded
that light occupied 16 minutes in travelling across the earth’s orbit.</p>

<p>With the view of rendering the above intelligible to those not
familiar with the subject, I offer the following illustration:—Suppose
it to be known that about a certain hour a gun will be fired at
a remote spot, the direction of which, but not the distance, is known,
and that two persons (A. and B.) arrange to avail themselves of the
opportunity for ascertaining, approximately, the velocity of sound;
then, each being furnished with a good watch marking seconds, A.
places himself at a certain spot, and B. at a known distance—say a
mile—from A., and in a direction opposite to that of the gun, so
that B.’s distance from the gun shall be a mile greater than A.’s—the
actual distance in either case is unimportant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>Each now records the exact moment at which he hears the report;
and if the gun be fired repeatedly, several such records are made, in
order to give a more accurate result.</p>

<p>A. and B. then meet and compare notes. They, of course, find
that A.’s time is in each instance earlier than B.’s. The average of
the several differences would be about 4¾ seconds—showing that
sound travels a mile in that time.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>The mode of procedure here described is, of course, not that
actually adopted for determining the velocity of sound, but it is a
practicable mode, and is selected because it is analogous to that
adopted by Römer for determining the velocity of light.</p>

<p>A copy of Professor Phillips’s Address was sent to me immediately
after its delivery, and, on my detecting the error, I
endeavoured to induce a friend of his, deservedly eminent as a
practical astronomer, to draw the Professor’s attention thereto, with
a view to its correction before the publication of the permanent
report of the Society’s proceedings; but, unfortunately, the attempt
did not succeed.</p>

<p>In another similar case, however, as appears by the following
correspondence between the Astronomer Royal and myself, I was
more successful:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—Pray accept my thanks for the copy of your
Report. It came while I was at Brighton; but, since my return
home, I have read it with great interest. I felt it a great privation
not to be able to attend the Visitation.</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to request your attention to what appear
to me to be serious errors in the recent annual Address of the
President of the Astronomical Society? They will be found in the
last paragraph of page 119 of the ‘Monthly Notices’ for February.
To save you trouble, I have extracted the part in question, and have
underlined the words which I think erroneous. ‘At the present
time the Earth is about three millions of miles nearer to the Sun
in our northerly winter than in our summer; our coldest month is
about 60° Fh. colder than our hottest, and our winter lasts for about
eight days <i>longer</i> than our summer. M. Leverrier has calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
that 200,000 years ago the Earth approached the Sun by upwards of
ten millions of miles nearer in winter than in summer: the winters
were then nearly a month <i>longer</i> than the summers, and in the
latitude of London there was a difference of about 112° Fh. between
the hottest and the coldest periods of the year.’</p>

<p>“If you find that I am right, perhaps you will have the kindness
to draw Mr. Pritchard’s attention to the errors, with a view to their
correction before the Address is printed in the ‘Transactions.’ I
would write to Mr. Pritchard myself, but that, as I could not speak
with authority, I might give offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>The following narrative seems to show that in a progressive
science like Astronomy even the highest authority is not infallible.</p>

<p>Some sixty years ago, my attention having been accidentally
drawn to a tide-mill for grinding corn, I began to consider what
was the source of the power employed, and came to the conclusion
that it was the momentum of the earth’s revolution on its axis.
The next question I asked myself was—could such power be
diverted, in however slight a degree, without drawing, as it were,
on the stock? Further consideration showed me that the draught
required for grinding the corn was trifling in comparison with that
employed in grinding the pebbles on every seashore upon the earth’s
surface; and, consequently, that the drain on the earth’s momentum
might suffice in the course of ages to effect an appreciable retardation
in the earth’s diurnal revolution.</p>

<p>I now, as usual in case of difficulty, applied to my father. He
could detect no fault in my reasoning, but informed me that Laplace
had demonstrated in his great work (“<i>La Mécanique Céleste</i>”) that
the time occupied in the earth’s diurnal revolution is absolutely
invariable. Of course both my father and I accepted the authority
as unquestionable; but I never could fully satisfy my mind on the
subject, and for the greater part of my life it was a standing puzzle.</p>

<p>It may be stated briefly that Laplace’s demonstration appears to
have rested mainly on the fact that his Lunar Tables, if employed in
calculating backwards certain eclipses of the Sun which happened
about 2,000 years ago, give results agreeing so nearly with the
ancient records as altogether to exclude the possibility of any
appreciable increase in the length of the sidereal day during that
long period.</p>

<p>But in the year 1866 Professor Adams (really the first discoverer
of the planet Neptune) received the Gold Medal of the Astronomical
Society for, among other recent claims, the discovery of an error in
the data on which Laplace constructed his Lunar Tables which
vitiates the above demonstration.</p>

<p>The details of this important discovery—and the co-operation
therein of M. Delaunay—were fully and ably stated by Mr. Warren
De La Rue, then President of the Society, on the presentation of
the Medal.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> And the position of the question two years later is
concisely stated as follows by the Rev. Charles Pritchard, in an
Addendum to his address as President in 1868:—“<i>At present</i>,
then, the case stands thus,—the Lunar Tables, if calculated on the
principles of gravitation alone, as expounded by Messrs. Adams and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Delaunay, and as confirmed by other mathematicians, will not
exactly represent the moon’s true place at intervals separated by
2,000 years, provided the length of the day is assumed to be uniform
and unaltered during the whole of the intervening period. There
are grounds, however, for at least suspecting that, owing to the
effects of tidal action, the diurnal rotation is, and has been, in a
state of extremely minute retardation; but the mathematical difficulties
of the case, owing greatly to the interposition of terrestrial
continents, are so great that no definite quantitative results have
hitherto been attainable. The solution of the difficulty is one
of those questions which are reserved for the Astronomy of the
future.”<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>I need not say that this confirmation of the truth of my early
conjecture proved highly gratifying. I have only to add that the
increase during the last 2,000 years in the length of the sidereal day
is generally estimated at about the eightieth part of a second; but
the estimate has, I apprehend, no better foundation than this—namely,
that since the recent correction in the Lunar Tables an
assumed increase to the extent in question has become necessary
in order to make the backward calculation of the ancient eclipses
agree with the records as to time.</p>

<p>I have found it very difficult at my age (little less than fourscore),
and with my mental powers seriously impaired, to deal, however
imperfectly, with a subject so abstruse as that now under consideration;
and I think it by no means improbable that there may
be some error in my statement of facts or in my argument thereon.</p>

<p>All that I can say is that I have done my best to render intelligible
to ordinary readers an important advance in modern Astronomy—interesting
in itself, irrespective of its remote and accidental connection
with my own biography.</p>

<p>The following very gratifying letter from the Astronomer Royal
may perhaps be appropriately given here. It is in reply to my
congratulations when, in recognition of his great public services, he
was made a K.C.B.:—</p>

<h4>“PREFACE TO THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY FOR
LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC IMPROVEMENT.</h4>

<p>“In presenting to the public ‘The Laws and Regulations of the
Society for Literary and Scientific Improvement,’ its members feel
it their duty briefly to state the motives which influenced them in
the formation of such an establishment, and to explain their reasons
for occasionally deviating in the construction of their Laws from
the systems which are generally adopted for the governance of
similar bodies.</p>

<p>“The experience of almost every one who has passed the time
usually devoted to education, but who still feels desirous of improvement,
must have convinced him of the difficulty of regularly
devoting his leisure hours to the object he has in view, from the
want of constantly acting motives, and the absence of regulations
which can enforce the observance of stated times. However strong
the resolutions he has made, and whatever may be his conviction
of the necessity of adhering to them, trivial engagements which
might easily be avoided, will furnish him, from time to time, with
excuses to himself for his neglect of study: thus may he spend
year after year, constantly wishing for improvement, but as constantly
neglecting the means of it, and old age may come upon
him before he has accomplished the object of his desires; then
will he look back with regret on the many opportunities he has
lost, and acknowledge in despair that the time is gone by.</p>

<p>“Under these impressions, a few individuals who are desirous of
extending their literary and scientific knowledge, have endeavoured
to establish a society for that purpose; convinced that by so doing
they have provided most powerful motives for mental improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has been thought highly desirable, that every member of the
society should be, as nearly as possible, upon an equality, that all
may feel alike interested in the success of the whole. In order
to accomplish this important object, every regular auditor is expected,
according to the rules of the society, to deliver a lecture
in his turn. Thus, instead of the society being divided into two
parties, one consisting of lecturers, the other of critics, every
member feels himself called upon to listen to the others with
candour and attention, as he is aware that the time will come
when he shall require the same consideration from them. It will
be observed also, on a perusal of the laws, that each lecture is
followed by a discussion. Thus care is insured on the part of the
lecturer that he shall not attempt a subject which he has not
well studied; and an opportunity is given to every member to
obtain an explanation of anything advanced, which he may not
have understood, or to express his opinions on the questions that
may arise, and, by these means, correct or confirm his own ideas.
But the principal advantage of a discussion is, that it calls forth
the individual exertion of every member, by inviting each to take
a part in the general instruction, and thus affording constant inducements
to private reading and study.</p>

<p>“In a town so populous as Birmingham, and which for superiority
in art is dependent on the discoveries of science, it cannot be
doubted that many individuals may be found who are desirous
of intellectual advancement. For such persons ‘The Society for
Literary and Scientific Improvement’ was established; and they
are respectfully and earnestly invited to lend their assistance towards
the promotion of its objects. The society cannot promise that
they shall meet with any considerable talent or learning among its
members; but in mixing with their equals, with young men of
similar tastes and similar pursuits, they may hope to find in a
generous emulation most powerful motives for application and
perseverance.</p>

<p>“The details of management of a society like this, may, on a
superficial view, appear of little importance; those, however, who
have had opportunities of closer examination, will, it is presumed,
agree with the members of this Institution, in considering an
attention to such particulars as necessary, not only to the well-being,
but to the permanent existence of an association, for
whatever purpose it may be formed.</p>

<p>“With views like these, the ‘Society for Literary and Scientific
Improvement’ have been anxious to establish a mode of electing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
the Committee, that should secure (as nearly as possible), an
accurate representation of the whole body; not only because it
appeared reasonable that the members would feel interested in
the welfare of the Institution, in proportion as the arrangements
and regulations met their own views and wishes, but because experience
proves that, owing to imperfect methods of choosing those
who are to direct the affairs of a society, the whole sway sometimes
gets into the hands of a small party, and is exercised, perhaps
unconsciously, in a way that renders many persons indifferent, and
alienates others, until all becomes listlessness, decay, and dissolution.</p>

<p>“Men of worth and talent, of every denomination in religion and
politics, will be welcome members of the society; and to prevent
any unpleasant collision of opinions, it has been thought advisable
to exclude altogether the discussion of subjects which have reference
to peculiarities in religious belief, or to the political speculations
of the day; the important questions which respect the wealth of
nations, however, as they have no connexion with passing politics,
are considered as among the proper objects for the society’s
attention.</p>

<p>“Such gentlemen as may feel desirous of improving their minds
by engaging in establishments of a nature similar to this, but who,
on account of their residing at a distance from any large town,
have not hitherto had the opportunity, will, it is hoped, be induced
by the regulations respecting corresponding members, to join the
society; and they may depend upon meeting with every attention,
whenever the Committee shall be favoured with their communications.”</p>

<h4>CUBE ROOTS.</h4>

<p>The mode of extracting the roots of <i>exact cubes</i> which I taught
the boys, and which was probably that adopted by Zerah Colbourn,
will be best shown by an example. Suppose the question to be,
What is the cube root of 596,947,688? This looks like a formidable
array of figures, and a schoolboy, resorting to the usual mode of
extracting the root, would fill his slate with figures, and perhaps
occupy an hour in the process. Zerah Colbourn or my class would
have solved the question in a minute, and without making any figures
at all. My class would have proceeded as follows: They would first
fix in their memories the number of millions (596) and the last
figure of the cube (8), disregarding all other figures. Then, knowing
the cubes of all numbers from 1 to 12 inclusive, they would at once
see that the first or left-hand figure of the root must be 8; and
deducting the cube of 8 (512) from 596, they would obtain a
remainder of 84. This they would compare with the difference
between the cube of 8 (512) and the cube of 9 (729), that is to
say, with 217; and seeing that it was nearly four-tenths of such
difference, they would conclude that the second figure of the root
was 4. The third or last figure of the root would require no calculation,
the terminal figure of an <i>exact</i> cube always indicating the
terminal figure of its root—thus 8 gives 2. The cube root, therefore,
is 842. In this process there is some risk of error as regards the
second figure of the root, especially when the third figure is large;
but with practice an expert calculator is able to pay due regard to
that and certain other qualifications which I could not explain
without making this note unduly long. As already stated, Zerah
Colbourn did occasionally blunder in the second figure; and this
circumstance assisted me in discovering the above process, which I
have little doubt is the one he followed. If, instead of an exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
cube, another number of nine figures be taken, the determination of
the third figure of the root, instead of being the easiest, becomes by
far the most difficult part of the calculation.</p>

<p>[This part of the explanation was written by Sir Rowland Hill, as a
note to the Prefatory Memoir, before the year 1871. What follows
was added in 1875.]</p>

<p>Rule for extracting the roots of imperfect cubes divisible into
three periods:—</p>

<p>1. Find first and second figures as described above.</p>

<p>2. Deduct cube of first figure from the first period (of the number
whose root is to be extracted), modified, if necessary, as hereafter
described.</p>

<p>3. Then multiply the number (expressed by both figures) by each
figure in succession, and by 3.</p>

<p>4. Deduct the product (or the significant figures thereof—see
example), from the remainder obtained as above. (See 2).</p>

<p>5. Divide the remainder <i>now</i> obtained by the square of the number
expressed by both figures (see 3), multiplied by 3—dropping
insignificant figures (see example),—and the quotient will be the
last figure (or 3rd figure) of the root.</p>

<p>I can confidently affirm from experience that there is nothing
in the above calculations too difficult for those who, possessing a
natural aptitude, are thoroughly well practised in mental arithmetic.
I doubt, however, whether the mode just described be exactly that
which we followed; our actual mode, looking at the results as
described above (which is in exact accordance with my Journal),
must, I think, have been more facile; but as it is fully fifty years
since I gave any thought to the subject, and as, in the eightieth
year of my age, I find my brain unequal to further investigation, I
must be contented with the result at which I have arrived.</p>

<p>It must be remarked, however, that cases will arise when some
modification of the process will be necessary. As, for instance,
when the first period of the cube is comparatively light, it may be
necessary to include therein one or more figures of the second
period treated as decimals; indeed, if the first period consist of a
single figure, it will be better to incorporate it with the second period,
and treat both together as one period,<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> relative magnitude in the first
period dealt with being important as a means of securing accuracy
in the last figure of the root. But expert calculators soon learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
adopt necessary modifications, and by the “give-and-take” process
to bring out the correct result. Indeed, I find it recorded in my
Journal that “small errors will sometimes arise which, under unfavourable
circumstances, will occasionally amount to a unit.” These
observations it must be understood to apply only to the extraction
of the roots of imperfect cubes, which Zerah Colbourn invariably
refused to attempt. When the cube is perfect, the last figure of
the root, as shown in the text, requires no calculation at all.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Example.</i></p>

<p>What is the cube root of 596,947,687?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This is the number treated above, except that in the
unit’s place 7 is substituted for 8, in order to render the number an
imperfect cube; so slight a change, however—though rendering it
necessary to <i>calculate</i> the last figure of the root,—will still leave the
root as before.]</p>

<p>Following the rule, we find the first and second figures of the root
in the manner described above. They are 8 and 4.</p>

<p>We next calculate the third or last figure of the root.</p>

<p>As the first figure of the second period of the cube is so large, it
will be unsafe to disregard it. Call the first period, therefore, 596·9;
all other figures may be neglected.</p>

<h4>VERNIER PENDULUM.</h4>

<p class="date">Bruce Castle, Tottenham,<br />
June 7th, 1832.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,—In troubling you with the following sketch of an
improvement in astronomical clocks, I have a two-fold object. First,
to obtain the loan of the necessary instruments, should you consider
the plan worth prosecuting; and, secondly, to avail myself of the
suggestions of such members of the Society as are more experienced
than myself in the minute details of practical astronomy. The
objects of the proposed improvement are: To supply an apparatus
capable of measuring time to a small fraction of a second, and to
make the determination of the exact time a matter of calm and
deliberate inquiry, and thus to avoid the errors which must frequently
arise from the hurry attending the present method.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish these objects, I propose to make use of
the principle of the Vernier, by suspending in front of the clock an
additional pendulum somewhat shorter than that of the clock, and
so placed that the coincidence of the two when vertical may be
determined by means similar to those used by Captain Kater; this
additional or Vernier pendulum to be put in motion at the instant of
observation by means of a trigger under the command of the observer
at the telescope, and its vibrations reckoned till a coincidence
takes place between it and the clock pendulum. This pendulum
may have a maintaining power and an index to save the trouble of
counting. When at rest, the Vernier pendulum must of course be
raised to the extent of its oscillation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span></p>

<p>The results of experiments commenced with very imperfect instruments
about two years and a-half ago, and continued at intervals to
the present time, appear to be as follows:—</p>

<p>When a Vernier pendulum, vibrating once in ·9 second, or 10
times in 9 seconds, is employed, its coincidences with the seconds
pendulum of the clock may be determined to a single vibration with
the greatest ease by the unassisted eye, and thus, of course, tenths
of a second are readily estimated.</p>

<p>When a Vernier pendulum vibrating once in ·99 second, or 100
times in 99 seconds, is employed, its coincidences with the seconds
pendulum of the clock may also be determined to a single vibration,
but not without the aid of a telescope. By these means hundredths
of a second are measured without much difficulty.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the inconvenience of having to suspend sometimes
one pendulum and sometimes the other, and also to escape
the loss of time which, if the hundredths pendulum were constantly
used, would arise when the observer wished to estimate tenths of a
second only, I propose to adopt the following arrangement:—To
employ a single Vernier pendulum of such a length as to vibrate
once in 8·99 second, or a thousand times in 899 seconds. This
pendulum differs so slightly from the tenths pendulum (making ten
vibrations in 8·99 seconds, instead of 9 seconds), that for estimating
tenths of a second it is practically the same, while it affords the
means of measuring hundredths of a second also. Its operation
will be best understood by an example:—Suppose the interval to be
measured by means of the Vernier to be ·24 second. At the second
and third vibrations of the Vernier pendulum after its release there
would be approximate coincidences between it and the clock pendulum,
showing the fraction of time to be between two-tenths and
three-tenths of a second. The coincidence at the second vibration
would, however, be somewhat nearer than that at the third. At the
twelfth vibration there would be another approximate coincidence
somewhat closer than the first. At the twenty-second vibration there
would be a yet closer coincidence. At the thirty-second one closer
still, and at the forty-second vibration the coincidence would be the
most accurate of the series. Thus it appears that the tenths of a
second may be known by counting single vibrations of the Vernier
pendulum till a coincidence of some kind occurs, and that the hundredths
of a second may be determined by counting the decades of
vibrations, or all the coincidences after the first, until the most exact
coincidence arises.</p>

<p>By the use of the Vernier pendulum, when connected with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
index, all chance of error in reading the clock will, it is conceived,
be avoided. Having touched the trigger at the moment of observation,
the observer has, as it were, registered the time, and he may
examine the clock at his leisure, for it is manifest that a comparison
of the index of the Vernier pendulum with that of the clock will at
any time determine the moment of observation. It will also be seen
that, should the observer omit to notice the first coincidence of the
pendulums, no inconvenience except delay will arise, because the
same coincidences will occur in a regular series as long as the pendulums
continue in motion.</p>

<p>There are a few provisions necessary for extreme accuracy which,
in this hasty sketch, it would be out of place to notice. I will just
mention, however, that the apparatus contains within itself the means
of measuring what may be called <i>the mean error of the observer</i>, or
the average interval which, as regards the particular individual,
elapses between the instant of observation and the release of the
Vernier pendulum.</p>

<p>To subject the plan which I have here attempted hastily to describe
to a rigid trial will require instruments of much greater
accuracy than those which I can command, and if the Society
possess a good clock not now in use, I shall feel extremely obliged
if I can obtain the loan of it. An additional pendulum the requisite
length, is not, I presume, to be found among the Society’s
instruments.</p>

<h4>COACH COMPANY.</h4>

<p>Two (or more) principal offices to be established in convenient
places for business—say, <i>one near the Bank, and one near the Regent
Circus, Piccadilly</i>; these offices to communicate with each other by
means of omnibuses.</p>

<p><i>Coaches and omnibuses to radiate from these offices to all parts of
the environs of London.</i></p>

<p>A country office to be established at the extremity of each route.</p>

<p>The town to be divided into small districts, and the country into
larger, each with a house for the receipt and distribution of <i>parcels</i>.
(Shopkeepers who have goods to distribute in the neighbourhood
may undertake this). These stations to be, as far as practicable, on
the routes of the coaches.</p>

<p>The principal and the country offices to be receiving and distributing
houses, each for its own district.</p>

<p>Each coach in coming from the country to collect parcels from the
stations on its route, bringing them to its principal office. On going
out, to carry parcels for distribution from the principal office to the
same stations. Thus every parcel will pass through one or other of
the principal offices. (Exceptions can be made, if desirable, with
respect to parcels which would otherwise pass twice over the ground,
viz., those received at stations between the principal office and the
place of their destination; but the first arrangement would be by far
the most simple).</p>

<p>Stations not on a coach route must transfer parcels to the nearest
stations which are on a route, and receive parcels from the same.
[Qy. A small extra charge].</p>

<p>Places to be booked at any station for any coach; a memorandum
being transmitted to the principal office concerned, with the parcels.</p>

<p>In some cases the passengers themselves may be so transmitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>

<p>The omnibuses passing between the principal offices to carry
passengers and parcels from each for the other. Thus every coach
will practically start from both principal offices.</p>

<p>Coaches to depart from each principal office all at the same time.
Say, for all principal places, once every hour, from —— in the morning
till —— at night.</p>

<p>Coaches to arrive at each principal office all at the same time, say
a few minutes before the time of departure, the interval being
sufficient to transfer passengers and parcels.</p>

<p>The periods of departure and arrival at one office to differ by half-an-hour
from the corresponding periods at the other, so as to allow
just time enough (calculated at half-an-hour), for a transfer by the
omnibuses from one office to the other. Thus the coaches from one
office will start at the beginning and from the other in the middle of
each hour.</p>

<p>Horses to be kept and changed at the country offices, or at
stations about the middle of each route. The latter arrangement
will make the stage shorter, and will bring the horse stations more
immediately under central revision. It will also require a less
number of horse stations, as in many cases one station will serve for
two or more roads branching out from each other. (At least one
pair of horses must be kept at the extreme station).</p>

<p>Supernumerary coaches and horses to be kept at the central offices
for use on any road on which there may be a temporary demand.</p>

<p>Each coachman to pay a certain rent, and with certain deductions
to receive the payments for passengers and parcels, but to have no
control as to the sum to be charged, the hour of starting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The masters of the stations to be remunerated by a certain sum
(to be paid by the coachman) for each passenger booked, and for
each parcel received or distributed.</p>

<p>Contracts to be made in all possible cases. Thus the coachmaker
may supply coaches at —— each per annum, or at —— per mile
travelled.</p>

<p>The keepers of the horse stations may contract each for the supply
of horses required at his station at —— per mile.</p>

<p>In disposing of the shares, a preference to be given to those who
would make frequent use of the coaches, especially to those who
travel to London daily, as their influence would materially promote
the interests of the concern.</p>

<p>A personal right to go to or from town daily, by the same coach,
to be sold for a period, say a week, at a considerably reduced rate,
or a month at a still lower rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>Proprietors to be entitled to similar privileges at five per cent. less
than others.</p>

<p>Transferable tickets, giving the holder a right to travel by any
coach in either direction on a particular road, to be sold (say twenty
at a time) at a slightly reduced rate.</p>

<p>All the carriages to be painted alike, and so as readily to distinguish
them from those not belonging to the Company.</p>

<p>An establishment on an extensive scale, such as is described in
the foregoing sketch, would possess many decided advantages over
the little independent establishments now existing. It would be
more economically managed; the necessary publicity would be more
easily given to its arrangements; the responsibility of the servants
would be more efficient; and the extent and permanence of the
undertaking would justify the most watchful attention to exact
punctuality, to a proper speed, to the safety and comfort of the
passengers, and, in short, to all circumstances conducive to a high
reputation with the public.</p>

<p><i>Economy.</i>—This would manifestly result from the great division of
labour, and the wholesale demand for every article of expenditure.
Also from the power of transferring coaches from any road on which
there was less to one on which there was more travelling than usual.</p>

<p>The system of contracts and sub-contracts could not be introduced
with advantage into a small concern.</p>

<p><i>Publicity.</i>—The readiness with which the arrangements could be
described would tend greatly to their publicity. Thus, it would be
easily said and easily remembered, that from a certain office coaches
depart every hour, and from a certain other office at the half-hour, to
all the principal places within the limits of the threepenny post.
This statement, with a list of the places, fares, &amp;c., would be
placarded at every station, and on every coach and omnibus.</p>

<p><i>Responsibility.</i>—An active and intelligent superintendent, well
acquainted with the means of holding others to responsibility, should
devote his whole time to the undertaking, visiting the various stations
periodically to see that all arrangements are observed, to settle the
accounts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He should require accurate reports to be made, showing at all
times the actual state of affairs, and the improvement or deterioration
in each department The most exact rules should be laid down
and enforced for the conduct of each class of servants. These rules
should be placarded in the coaches, at the stations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Enquiries as to the conduct of all concerned should be made
frequently of the proprietors who use the coaches daily, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
possible attention paid to the well-founded complaints of passengers
generally. A till might be placed in each carriage, with an inscription
requesting passengers having cause to complain to put a statement
of such complaint, with <i>name and address</i>, into the till, which
should be opened at the central office at least once in each day.</p>

<p><i>Punctuality and Speed.</i>—The proper time of starting and that of
passing each station should be inscribed conspicuously on each
coach, as well as at each station. The actual time kept should be
recorded at each extreme station and at the horse station, and fines
levied on the coachman for deviation beyond certain limits. The
allowance of time for the journey should be such as to require the
coachman to drive steadily but rapidly, with no stoppage beyond
a very short one (say a minute) at each station, and a little more for
taking up and putting down passengers on the road.</p>

<p>The coach should never wait nor turn out of the direct road
between the extreme stations. To save time, the passengers, in the
omnibuses at least, should be requested to pay as they go on. At
the inferior stations a signal might be established to show whether
the coach need stop or not.</p>

<p><i>Safety of Passengers.</i>—Coaches of the safest construction, steady
horses, and temperate coachmen, only should be employed; and
whenever an accident occurs from whatever cause, a heavy fine
should be levied on the coachman, allowing him the right to recover
the whole or part of the penalty of the coach-contractor or horse-contractor,
according to circumstances. No galloping should be
allowed.</p>

<p>The coach-contractor should be required to station a man at each
central office to examine each coach every time it comes in.</p>

<p><i>Comfort of Passengers.</i>—Some protection from wet and cold to be
provided for the outside passengers. Means of ascending and
descending to be improved. A convenient room at each station
for those waiting. The stations should <i>not</i> be taverns; but coffee
and some other refreshments may be provided—there being no
obligation, however, to call for anything. The room should contain
a map of London, directory, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the Company would be capable of gradual
and almost indefinite extension. Thus they might take in towns
more and more distant, or they might comprehend hackney-coaches,
cabriolets, and omnibuses to all parts of London. The machinery
required for the distribution of parcels might be applied to that of
the periodic publications; and a contract might be entered into,
advantageous to the public as well as to the Company, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
collection, carriage, and distribution of the twopenny and threepenny
post letters.</p>

<p>This distribution might easily take place <i>each hour</i>, the letters being
carried by the coaches. No guards would be required, as the bags
might be put into a boot, of which keys should be kept at the post-offices
only.</p>

Mr. John Forster, late Member for Berwick. In a marginal

<h4>“SIR ROWLAND HILL AND THE PRINTING PRESS.</h4>

<p class="date">“London, February 12, 1872.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In your interesting article on the ‘Walter Press’ it was
stated that the idea of a Rotatory Machine printing newspapers
on a continuous sheet of paper was not novel; that Sir Rowland
Hill had worked at it many years before, as had other persons in
America. As to most of your readers this mention of a benefactor
of theirs in another way as a mechanical inventor was no doubt
something new and curious, it may be interesting to them to learn
what Sir Rowland Hill’s share of merit in this matter was. I send
with this a copy of the specification of his patent for letter-press
printing machines, taken out in 1835 (No. 6762, printed by the
Patent Office in 1857), and an account of it given in the ‘Repertory
of Patent Inventions,’ No. 35. By these it will be seen that the
most important achievements of modern printing were effected by
Sir Rowland Hill thirty-seven years ago. His machine was to print
either with stereotype-plates or movable type (the difficulty of fastening
the last securely to cylinders revolving at great speed was met
by special contrivances); was itself to keep the printing surfaces
inked; to print a continuous roll of paper, of any length, and both
sides, while passing once through the apparatus; to cut up the roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
into sheets; and means were contrived of performing those operations
on two rolls at once, so that at one revolution of the printing cylinders
two copies could be struck off. Such a machine was actually
constructed (at an expense of about £2,000), and was frequently
shown at work at No. 44, Chancery Lane, as many persons must
remember. Though driven by hand, it could produce at the rate
of seven or eight thousand impressions in an hour. One great
difficulty of most printing machines is that of securing perfect
<i>register</i> (the exact coincidence of the printing on opposite sides
of the paper). This was anticipated and met by the patent. The
one thing the inventor failed to do was to overcome the resistance
the collectors of the stamp duty presented to this printing on a
continuous roll, and to the affixing of the stamps to the newspapers
at the proper intervals during their passage through the machine.
Many years afterwards they allowed this to be done by machinery
contrived by Mr. Edwin Hill (who had assisted his brother in the
preparation of the printing machine), which was affixed to the
presses of the <i>Times</i> and other papers, and which itself registered,
for the security of the revenue, the number of impressions made.
In 1835, the task of satisfying the Treasury that this could be done
with safety to it was too formidable to be overcome,—at least it was
not overcome. Sir Rowland Hill’s attention was soon afterwards
absorbed by his plans of postal reform; and no one can regret this,
seeing what work he did in the Post Office, which probably no one
but himself could have done so well; while if the fourteen years
of his patent passed unprofitably to the inventor, other hands have
carried to extraordinary perfection the scheme of a printing machine.
Of course the Americans and the ‘Walter Press’ have greatly
advanced on ‘Hill’s Machine’ of 1835; especially by the preparation
of stereotype plates for this particular service. In his
specification, Sir Rowland Hill made due mention of his predecessors,
recording that an imitation of the process of printing
calico by cylinders revolving rapidly was proposed for letter-press
printing as early as 1790, by Mr. William Nicholson, and that this
was applied to stereotype plates bent to a cylindrical surface by
Mr. Edward Cowper in 1816. But the first practical scheme of
newspaper printing on a continuous roll of paper by revolving
cylinders was produced and set to work by Rowland Hill in 1835.</p>

<p>[Two years later Sir Rowland Hill wrote the following
letter to the <i>Journal of the Society of Arts</i>:]—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“TYPE-PRINTING MACHINERY</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In the interesting paper ‘On Type-printing Machinery,’ by
the Rev. Arthur Rigg, which appeared in your <i>Journal</i> of the 13th
inst., there are certain errors affecting myself which I request
permission to correct.</p>

<p>“It is stated that rotating cylinders and continuous rolls of paper
were principles first introduced into type-printing machinery by Mr.
Nicholson in 1790, and further on it is asserted, in reference no
doubt to the printing machine which I invented in 1835, that I
‘revived a proposal of Nicholson’s.’</p>

<p>“Now, so far from Mr. Nicholson proposing to print from types on
continuous rolls of paper, a reference to the specification of his
invention (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1790, No. 1,748) will show that, excluding his
proposals for calico and wall-paper printing, which have nothing
to do with type-printing machinery, he invariably speaks of printing
on sheets of paper; indeed, the means of producing continuous
rolls of paper were not invented till several years later. Again, it
will be seen that the means he proposes for attaching the types to
his cylinder, the real difficulty to be overcome, are clearly insufficient
for the purpose; indeed, as stated in the specification of my patent
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1835, No. 6,762), which was drawn by the late Mr. Farey—a
man thoroughly conversant with the subject—‘on account of
deficiencies and imperfections in the machinery described in that
specification [Mr. Nicholson’s] the same has never been practised or
brought into use.’</p>

<p>“Towards the close of his paper, Mr. Rigg seems to imply that
hitherto all schemes for fixing moveable types on a cylinder have
failed. I can only say that in my machine this difficulty was
entirely overcome. Indeed, in a letter which appeared in the
<i>Mechanics’ Magazine</i> of November 12th, 1836 (when the subject
was before the public), I was enabled to state that ‘in the opinion
of many eminent printers who have seen my machine the end in
view has been fully accomplished, for while any portion of type may
be detached from the cylinder with a facility even greater than that
with which a similar change can be made in an ordinary form, each
letter can be so firmly locked in its place that there is no danger
whatever of its being loosened by centrifugal force or by any other
cause.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>“While upon this subject, I may as well add that a comparison
of my specification with that of the ‘Walter Press’ (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1866,
No. 3,222) will show that, except as regards the apparatus for
cutting and distributing the printed sheets, and excepting further
that the ‘Walter Press’ is only adapted for printing from stereotype
plates, while mine would not only print from stereotype plates, but,
what was far more difficult, from moveable types also, the two
machines are almost identical. I gladly admit, however, that the
enormous difficulty of bringing a complex machine into practical
use—a difficulty familiar to every inventor—has been most successfully
overcome by Messrs. Calverley and MacDonald, the patentees
of the ‘Walter Press.’</p>

<h4>EXTRACT FROM THE “GREENOCK ADVERTISER,” OF FRIDAY,
MARCH 8th, 1850.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Testimonial to</i> <span class="smcap">Robert Wallace</span>, Esq., <i>late M.P. for Greenock</i>.
<i>The Pioneer of Postage Reform.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, Esq., said,—Ladies and Gentlemen, the Committee
for promoting Mr. Wallace’s Testimonial having done me the
honour to invite me to take a part in this day’s proceedings, I felt
bound, at whatever inconvenience to myself, to attend and to repeat
the testimony which I have always gladly borne to the great and
important aid afforded by your late representative, my esteemed and
venerable friend Mr. Wallace, in the promotion of Penny Postage.
(Applause.) With the view of enabling you fairly to estimate the
value of Mr. Wallace’s important services, it will be necessary to
take a brief review of his career as a Post Office Reformer. I need
not remind you that Mr. Wallace entered the House of Commons as
your representative in the year 1833. At this time the Post Office
was considered by the public nearly perfect. But although several
improvements had been effected under the administration of the
Duke of Richmond, probably no department of government had,
during the previous twenty years, improved so little, and yet no department
had been so free from attack and complaint. It is true
that the Commissioners of Revenue Inquiry had a short time before,
with great ability, exposed much mismanagement in the Post Office,
and had recommended various improvements (some of which were
afterwards taken up by Mr. Wallace, and some still later by myself),
but these exposures and recommendations, buried as they were in
ponderous parliamentary reports, attracted little attention from the
public, who still continued to view the Post Office as a vast and
mysterious, but nearly perfect, machine. (Hear, hear.) I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
scarcely think, however, that it could have been so viewed by the
Government. They must, one would think, have been impressed
with the remarkable fact that, since the close of the war, notwithstanding
the great increase of population, and the still greater
increase of commercial activity, the revenue of the Post Office,
whether gross or net, had not increased at all. (Hear.) Such was
the state of things when Mr. Wallace, in the year 1833, first roused
the attention of Parliament and the public to the urgent necessity
for reform in the Post Office, which he attacked with that perseverance
and energy which distinguished all his proceedings; and,
not satisfied with attacking abuses, Mr. Wallace, even at this early
period of his parliamentary career, recommended an important improvement,
which subsequently, as part of the plan of Penny
Postage, was carried into effect with great advantage to the public.
The improvement to which I allude was the substitution of charge
by weight for charge by enclosure. (Applause.) In the year 1834
Mr. Wallace proposed in Parliament several other important measures,
among which were the following:—1st. The opening to public
competition of the contract for the construction of the mail coaches.
This measure, which was soon after adopted, effected a saving of
£17,218 a-year. 2nd. The consolidation of the London General
and District Post Offices. This measure subsequently formed
part of the plan of Penny Postage, and was partially carried into
effect, with most advantageous results, about three years ago.
Much, however, still remains to be accomplished. 3rd. The
appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into the management
of the Post Office. This recommendation was acted upon early
in the next year (1835), and the Commission continued its labours
till 1838. In the interval the Commission issued no less than
ten reports, and it is fairly entitled to the credit of much of the
subsequent improvement in the Post Office. During the year
1835, Mr. Wallace appears to have suspended his exertions in
Parliament, thinking probably that he should more effectually
serve the cause to which he had devoted himself by assisting
in the investigations of the Commission. Accordingly, I find him
giving evidence before that body, in the course of which he
recommended the following improvements among others:—1st.
The establishment of day mails, which subsequently formed part
of my plan, and has been carried into effect with great advantage
to the public and to the revenue. 2nd. A reduction in the rates
of postage. 3rd. More frequent communication between places,
Mr. Wallace expressing an opinion, since confirmed by experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
that the revenue, as well as the public, would be benefited thereby.
In 1836 Mr. Wallace resumed his labours in Parliament, recommending
among other measures:—1st. A reduction of the rates
of postage, naming 8<i>d.</i> or 9<i>d.</i> as a maximum. 2nd. The registration
of letters, since carried into effect with advantage both to the public
and to the revenue. (Applause.) 3rd. That the postage charge should
be regulated by the distance along the shortest practicable road, instead
of being determined, as it then was, by the circuitous route
through which the Post Office might, for its own convenience, carry the
letter. It is now difficult to believe that only a few years since a system
so monstrous as that which Mr. Wallace successfully attacked should
have been suffered to exist for a single day—a system under which
6<i>d.</i> or 8<i>d.</i> was sometimes charged on letters passing between places
not more than as many miles asunder, merely because the Post
Office, for its own convenience, preferred to carry the letters round
about. (Hear.) I have now arrived at the period when my intercourse
with Mr. Wallace commenced; and in order that you may
form a just appreciation of the valuable aid afforded me by Mr.
Wallace, it is necessary to consider well his position and that of
the Post Office at this time. By four years of incessant attacks,
Mr. Wallace had destroyed the <i>prestige</i> once enjoyed by the Post
Office, and had thus exposed it to the wholesome influence of public
opinion; in addition to which he had effected some important
improvements. By these means he had made the subject of the
Post Office his own, and was by general consent the Post Office
Reformer of the day. It was therefore in his power greatly to aid,
or greatly to discourage, the exertions of others. (Cheers.) In this
year (1836), through the intervention of one of my brothers, then
Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, I applied to Mr. Wallace for the
loan of any books he might possess relating to the Post Office, and
he very kindly lent me various Parliamentary reports and returns.
(Hear, hear.) These documents afforded me essential aid in the
work which I had long meditated, but in which I then for the first
time earnestly engaged. The result was a thorough conviction in my
own mind that the inland rate of postage ought to be the same for
all distances, and that provided the postage of letters were prepaid,
the rate might be reduced as low as 1<i>d.</i> throughout the United
Kingdom. (Applause.) I did not, however, (and I distinctly stated
as much at the time), reckon on effecting so vast a reduction without
a considerable loss of net revenue, though I did calculate on
eventually obtaining as large a gross revenue as before. But the
greatest difficulty of my task had still to be overcome. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
difficulty consisted in the apparent hopelessness of convincing
others that results so startling, and <i>primâ facie</i> so paradoxical, could
really be derived from a careful examination and accurate appreciation
of the facts of the case. Entertaining these apprehensions, and
having regard to Mr. Wallace’s position as the leading Post Office
Reformer of the day, I was exceedingly anxious as to the view which
he might take of my plan. I felt that its success or failure would
greatly depend on his verdict. Accordingly, at the beginning of
1837, I sent Mr. Wallace a copy of my pamphlet (which, in the first
instance, was printed for private circulation), and waited in the
greatest anxiety for his opinion. It came couched in kind and
encouraging language, conveying his hearty concurrence in the main
features of the plan, and I at once felt that a most important advance
had been made. It is impossible to speak too strongly of my
obligations to Mr. Wallace at this time. Many a man circumstanced
as he was would have treated me as an intruder—as one coming to
poach on his warren; but Mr. Wallace, so far from evincing any
jealousy, at once gave me all the advantage of his position, and
before the public had declared in favour of my plan, he had adopted
it with all his accustomed heartiness. (Applause.) Almost immediately
on the issue of my pamphlet, both Mr. Wallace and myself
were examined by the Post-Office Commissioners with reference to
the application of my plan to the London District post—a measure
which the Commissioners recommended, though unfortunately their
recommendation was not adopted by the Government. From this
time the progress of public opinion in favour of the plan of Penny
Postage was so rapid, that before the end of the year Mr. Wallace
had succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a committee of the
House to investigate its merits. Of this committee Mr. Wallace
was the active and indefatigable chairman. It continued to sit
throughout the session of 1838, in the course of which it examined
no less than eighty-three witnesses; and the labour to the chairman,
whose duties were by no means confined to the sittings of the
committee, was most severe. The result of the investigation is well
known, but it may not be in the recollection of this meeting that the
committee having been nominated by Government, which was then
unfavourable to Penny Postage, contained several members who
were, <i>ex officio</i>, opponents of the measure, and that the resolution
establishing the vital principle of uniformity of rate was carried only
by the casting vote of the chairman. (Hear, hear, and applause.)
Had Mr. Wallace given his casting vote on the other side, or even
withheld it, the adoption of Penny Postage would probably have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
been delayed for years,—possibly the plan might have been altogether
abandoned. The Report of the committee, one of the ablest
documents ever laid before Parliament, gave an extraordinary
impetus to the demand for Penny Postage, and in the session of
1839 upwards of 2,000 petitions, with more than a quarter of a
million of signatures (though a large proportion of the petitions being
from corporate bodies bore only a single signature each), were
presented to the House of Commons alone; and before the end
of the session, and within the short space of two years and a-half
from its announcement, Penny Postage became the law of the land.
(Applause.) During the greater part of this period (at least so long
as Parliament was sitting) I was in almost daily communication
with Mr. Wallace. The labour which we both had to go through
was enormous; and I never shall forget how much I felt cheered
and encouraged to persevere, by his own hearty, earnest, and confident
manner of encountering the difficulties and disappointments
necessarily incidental to so vast an undertaking. (Loud applause.)
It would ill become me to speak of the commercial and social
advantages which have resulted from Penny Postage. Under its
operation, the number of chargeable letters has increased from
76 millions to 337 millions per annum, and though the net revenue,
owing to the enormous cost of railway conveyance and other causes
into which I cannot with propriety enter, is much less than my
estimate, the gross revenue has realized that estimate, being now
nearly, if not quite, as great as before the reduction of the rates.
But whatever may have been the sacrifice of revenue, most people
now readily admit the benefit to the nation at large has been cheaply
purchased. (Cheers.) The advantages of cheap Postage however
are by no means confined to this country. Our example has been
followed, more or less closely, by several of the nations of Europe,
and by the United States of America; and it is most gratifying
to know that cheap Postage is gradually extending over the civilized
world. The manner in which Mr. Wallace, the earliest Post Office
Reformer of the present generation, has laboured zealously and
successfully to bring about these happy results, has been shown
by the statement of facts with which I have felt it my duty to
trouble this meeting, and I earnestly hope that the people of this
great country, who so munificently rewarded my exertions, will
recognise also the claims of Mr. Wallace, and will step forward
to cheer in the decline of life a man so justly entitled to our respect
and gratitude. Mr. Hill then sat down amid hearty demonstrations
of applause.</p>

<h4>UNIFORM PENNY POSTAGE.<br />
<i>Facts and Estimates as to the Increase of Letters.</i></h4>

<p>The only point connected with uniform Penny Postage on which
there appears to be any material difference of opinion is as to
whether or not the revenue will suffer by the proposed reduction.</p>

<p>The plan will stimulate the increase of letters in two ways. First,
by the increased facilities of despatch of letters;—second, by the
great reduction of postage.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Increased Facilities.</span></h5>

<p>Many facts were proved in evidence before the Postage Committee
which render it clear that even at the same or higher rates of postage,
increasing the opportunities of despatching letters, and the rapidity
with which they are transmitted and delivered, always increases the
number sent.</p>

<p>1. Palmer’s adoption of mail-coaches, though accompanied with
repeated <i>advances</i> of postage, increased the number of letters three-fold
in twenty years. And</p>

<p>2. The new facilities of transmission afforded by the Manchester
and Liverpool railway, increased the number of letters between the
termini nearly fifty per cent. in six years; postage remaining the same.</p>

<p>3. Although not substantiated before the Postage Committee, it is
understood that the recent establishment of a morning mail from
London to Brighton has produced a similar effect.</p>

<p>4. It appears from the valuable work of M. Piron “<i>Sous Directeur
des Postes aux Lettres</i>,” that a reduction in the time of transmission
from Paris to Marseilles, from 118 to 68 hours, has doubled the
number of letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Reduction of Postage.</span></h5>

<p>This is relied upon as by far the most efficient cause of increase in
the number of letters.</p>

<p>It has been found that the decrease of price in any article of
general demand, so far from lessening the amount of the public
expenditure on such article, has always increased it.</p>

<p>1. “The price of soap, for instance, has recently fallen by about
one-eighth; the consumption in the same time has increased by one-third.
Tea, again, the price of which, since the opening of the
China trade, has fallen by about one-sixth, has increased in consumption
by almost a half. The consumption of silk goods, which,
subsequently to the year 1823, have fallen in price by about one-fifth,
has more than doubled. The consumption of coffee, the price
of which, subsequently to 1823, has fallen about one-fourth, has
more than tripled. And the consumption of cotton goods, the
price of which, during the last twenty years, has fallen by nearly one-half,
has in the same time been fourfolded.”—<i>Post Office Reform</i>,
p. 70.</p>

<p>2. The sale of newspapers for the twelve months before the late
reduction in stamps was—</p>

<p>35,576,056,<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> at an average price, say of 7<i>d.</i>, costing the public
£1,037,634.</p>

<p>For the twelve months subsequent to the reduction, it was—</p>

<p>53,496,207,<a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> at an average price, say of 4¾<i>d.</i>, costing the public
£1,058,779.</p>

<p>3. The annual number of advertisements before the late reduction
in the advertisement duty, was—</p>

<p>1,010,000<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> at an average price, say of 6<i>s.</i>, costing the public
£303,000.</p>

<p>It is now—</p>

<p>1,670,000, at an average price, say of 4<i>s.</i>, costing the public
£334,000.</p>

<p>4. The number of persons paying for admission to the Tower was,
in the ten months prior to the late reduction—</p>

<p>9,508, at 3<i>s.</i>, each (including the Warder’s fee), = £1,426.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ten months subsequent to the reduction it was—</p>

<p>37,431, at 1<i>s.</i> each, = £1,871.</p>

<p>The rule established by these facts, viz., that the demand for the
article increases in a greater proportion than the price decreases,
so that if one thousand are sold at 1<i>s.</i> many more than two thousand
would be sold at 6<i>d.</i>, is, it is believed, without exception. Certainly
the article of postage does not furnish one.</p>

<p>“The reduction of the Irish postage rates which was made in
1827, was immediately followed by a considerable increase in the
Irish Post Office revenue, though precisely to what extent it would
be difficult to state, owing to a transfer that was made at the same
time of certain receipts from the English to the Irish Post Office
revenue. An alteration was made in the year 1831, which was
equivalent to a partial reduction, by exempting the correspondence
of a portion of the metropolis, which had paid the General-post rate,
from paying an additional Twopenny-post rate. Consequent on this
reduction, though at first attended with some loss, the Post Office
revenue was improved to the amount of £10,000 a year, instead of
there being a loss of £20,000 a year as had been expected by the
Post Office. A reduction made in 1835, on the rates of ship-letters,
has been followed by a considerable increase in that branch of the
revenue.”<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>—<i>Third Report of the Select Committee on Postage</i>, p. 29.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Practical Effect of Reduction to One Penny.</span></h5>

<p>The postage of letters between Edinburgh and the adjacent towns
and villages was, in 1837, reduced from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>d.</i> In rather more
than a year the letters had more than doubled, and were on the
increase when the last returns were made.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Postage between Stroud and Nailsworth in Gloucestershire was
recently reduced from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>d.</i> The number of letters has already
increased about sixfold.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Future Gross Revenue of the Post Office.</span></h5>

<p>There seems, then, no rational ground of fear that the gross
revenue of the Post Office will be diminished.</p>

<p>On the contrary, its increase might be safely predicted, even if no
other change was contemplated than the proposed reduction. But
taking the proposed additional facilities for the despatch of letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
into account, the increase of the gross revenue may, at no distant
period, be fairly expected to be considerable. Many persons, competent
to form a sound opinion, think such increase will be very
large.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Future Expenses of the Post Office.</span></h5>

<p>The proposed changes will operate partly to increase, and partly
to decrease, the cost of the Post Office.</p>

<p>The <i>increase</i> will arise out of the additional number of letters
passing through the post.</p>

<p>The <i>decrease</i>, chiefly from the postage being paid in advance, by
means of stamps.</p>

<p>The <i>balance</i> will probably be a comparatively slight augmentation
of expense, which, it is confidently expected, will be more than
compensated by the increase of the customs, excise, &amp;c., produced
by the stimulus to commerce, consequent on the cheapness of
postage.</p>

<p><i>There is, then, no just reason for believing that the proposed reduction
in Postage will at all diminish the revenue of the country.</i></p>

<p>Below I have drawn out an estimate of the course which things
may probably take after the proposed change, on the supposition of
the gross revenue remaining the same as at present. I have perhaps
undervalued some sources of increase, and overestimated others. I
do not place much reliance on the details, but I have great confidence
that the general result will hereafter be found below the
truth.</p>

to Mr. Edwin Hill, under whose supervision it is placed, that we
should mention the constant improvements which are every day
being introduced in the machinery for impressing or manufacturing
stamps, although it is impossible to enumerate or explain them in
detail.</p>

<p>“The most remarkable of Mr. Hill’s inventions was one which
has now become of comparatively minor importance, namely, the
application of steam power to newspaper stamping. By a very ingenious
contrivance, the unwieldy sheets of paper for newspapers,
which used to be presented for stamping in immense quantities at a
time, were separated, turned over, and stamped, with a dispatch and
accuracy which had previously been considered as unattainable; and
the superior execution of the work, instead of increasing the expense,
was attended with a saving of at least £2,000 a-year.”</p>

His most recent addition to our machinery, a contrivance for fixing

<p>... “The pressure on our stamping department was at first
very great, and the administrative and mechanical resources of Mr.

<p class="center">[Dated the <i>6th May, 1872</i>.]</p>

<p>“The Board, in accepting this resignation, desire to place on
record their sense of the exemplary manner in which Mr. Hill has at
all times discharged his official duties, and their great regret at the
termination of a career which has been of so much advantage to the
public service.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hill has proved himself to be a most valuable servant of the
public, not merely in the general conduct of the business confided to
his superintendence, but also, and more especially in the application
of his inventive mechanical skill to numerous contrivances which
he has from time to time introduced, by which the work of his
department has been greatly facilitated and improved.</p>

<p>“The saving of time, labour, and expense which has accrued to
the public benefit by means of these appliances, some of which are
more particularly referred to by Mr. Hill, can scarcely be overestimated:
and there can be no doubt that these important results
have been attained at the cost of much independent thought and
labour on the part of Mr. Hill, whilst no personal benefit has been
derived from them by himself.</p>

<p>“Their Lordships have been pleased, under the powers conferred
upon them by the Superannuation Act, to mark, on certain occasions,
their sense of eminent and exceptional service by the award of a

than that which is now presented to their Lordships, and which the
Board desire to support with their strongest recommendation.”</p>

<h4>LETTER TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,
SUGGESTING TRANSFERENCE OF COLONEL MABERLY
TO ANOTHER POST.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Downing Street, June 23, 1841.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I have to apologize for troubling you at such a
time with considerations which may appear personal. Nothing but
the conviction that they are not really so, and further, that they
do not admit of delay, can justify the present application.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me as possible that the official changes now in
progress may afford an opportunity of placing me (without injury to
any one) in a position more favourable to the success of the measure
in which I am engaged.</p>

<p>I think you will agree that to complete the introduction of my
plan requires a careful consideration of numerous measures of detail,
and a close and constant watchfulness over their working. Also,
that its financial success depends on a rigid and searching economy
in every branch of management.</p>

<p>I am sure you will do me the justice to admit that I have
patiently and anxiously sought to accomplish these objects under
the existing arrangements, and yet a review of the last twelve
months (that is to say, of the period since we entered on the
details of the measure) shows, I fear, that little of this kind has
been effected.</p>

<p>If progress is thus slow while I enjoy your powerful support (and
for the kindness and constancy with which it has been afforded I
shall always feel most grateful), what will be the result if, unfortunately,
that support should be even temporarily withdrawn?</p>

<p>Will you therefore excuse the liberty I take in respectfully suggesting
for your consideration whether it is not highly important to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
the success of the measure that I should henceforward take a
position in the Post Office, and whether the official changes now in
progress may not afford opportunity for creating the necessary
vacancy without any injury to Colonel Maberly? Such a change
could not, I presume, be otherwise than agreeable to him; it would
relieve him from the unpleasant task of working out a measure
which he dislikes, and which he has repeatedly affirmed cannot
succeed; a measure, therefore, whose success cannot add to his
reputation, and whose failure is not unlikely to be attributed, however
undeservedly, to his mode of conducting it.</p>

<p>At the same time the proposed change would put an end to a
divided, unacknowledged, and therefore ineffectual responsibility,
without, I should hope, depriving me of the great advantage I have
hitherto enjoyed of submitting every important question to your
judgment.</p>

<p>Permit me to add that, as I have no desire to advance my own
emoluments, the suggested change would effect a saving to the
revenue of Colonel Maberly’s present salary and allowances.</p>

<p>May I be allowed to hope that, whatever may be your decision on
the arrangement I have ventured to suggest, you will excuse the
liberty I have taken, and attribute my conduct to the motive by
which alone I am influenced, viz., an earnest and anxious desire to
establish speedily and beyond all question the success of a
measure on which not only my whole reputation is at stake, but
which, in case of failure, or even of partial success, is sure to be
used as a ground of attack against the Government by which it has
been adopted.</p>

<p>Let me beg that you will not take the trouble to answer this letter
till you return to town. In bringing the matter under your notice
before the completion of the official arrangements referred to above,
the immediate object which I have in view is accomplished.</p>

teach some still smaller children to read. The book we used was Mrs. Barbauld’s
“Early Lessons.” We came to the word mezereon. I was ashamed to own that I
did not know how it was pronounced. With great gravity I informed my class
that this was a word that no one knew how to read. So far as I can remember
there was no doubting Thomas present.</p>

elected, which shall consist of at least one-fifth of the members of the Society.
The mode of election shall be as follows:—A ticket shall be delivered to each
member present, with his own name at the head of it, immediately under which
he shall write the name of the member whom he may wish to represent him in the
Committee. The votes thus given, shall be delivered to the president, who, after
having assorted them, shall report to the meeting the number of votes given for
each nominee. Every one who has five votes shall be declared a member of the
Committee; if there are more than five votes given to any one person, the surplus
votes (to be selected by lot) shall be returned to the electors whose name they
bear, for the purpose of their making other nominations, and this process shall be
repeated till no surplus votes remain, when all the inefficient votes shall be returned
to the respective electors, and the same routine shall be gone through a second
time, and also a third time if necessary; when if a number is elected, equal in all
to one-half of the number of which the Committee should consist, they shall be a
Committee; and if at the close of the meeting the number is not filled up, by
unanimous votes of five for each member of the Committee, given by those persons
whose votes were returned to them at the end of the third election, then this
Committee shall have the power, and shall be required, to choose persons to fill up
their number; and the constituents of each member so elected shall, if necessary,
be determined by lot. The President, Secretary, and Treasurer, all for the time
being, shall be members of the Committee, <i>ex-officio</i>, whether elected or not. In
the intervals between the general elections, it shall be competent to any four members
of the society, by a joint nomination, in a book to be opened for the purpose,
to appoint a representative in the ensuing Committee; such appointment being
made shall not be withdrawn, nor shall the appointers give any vote in the
choice of a Committee-man, as such, until after the next election. A register shall
be kept by the Secretary of the constituents of every member of the Committee;
and the constituents of any member, except those appointed by the Committee,
(upon whose dismissal that body may exercise a negative,) shall have the power of
withdrawing their representative, by a vote of their majority, of which vote notice
in writing shall be given (subscribed by the persons composing such majority) both
to the member so dismissed, and to the Chairman of the Committee; and in the
case of a vacancy occasioned by a dismissal as above, or by any other cause, the
constituents of the member whose place becomes vacant, may elect another in his
stead, by a unanimous vote, but not otherwise; if such election be not made within
a fortnight after the vacancy has occurred, the appointment shall devolve upon the
Committee.”</p>

at which I have arrived.”</p>

measured, and the whole afterwards reduced by computation to the exact
horizontal distance. It may be added, that in order to make due allowance for
the elongation or contraction of the rods by change of temperature, thermometers
were attached to the apparatus, and the rise and fall of the mercury duly

of this Act was carried. In few places was there greater suffering than in
Birmingham. Rowland Hill, before he set out for London, had passed near the
Birmingham Workhouse while a crowd was gathered round the doors waiting for
their weekly dole. One of them called out to him, “Look there, Sir; there’s a
sight, while they’re a-passing their Horpus Corpus Acts. Damn their Horpus
Corpus Acts, say I.”</p>

“a very exclusive society for procuring private concerts. It was supposed
that the society’s strict rule would be waived in favour of so distinguished a visitor
as Mr. Campbell; but upon application being made for his admission to one of
these performances, answer was returned that no exception had been made even in
the case of an officer who had bled for his country, and whose claims were of
course very superior to any that could be advanced by Mr. Campbell.”</p>

writes of him:—“Judging by what I observed, I should say that, wide as was
the range of his knowledge—far wider, indeed, than I could measure,—it was
deficient in accuracy, and therefore in profundity. This, indeed, must be evident
to all who regard the undulatory theory of light as now fully established....
Other instances of inaccuracy, doubtless of a minor, but yet of a serious character,
I found in his essay on Hydrostatics, written for the Useful Knowledge Society,
and, as it happened, referred to me by the Committee for report thereon. On the
other hand, I found much more of kindliness in him than the world generally
gave him credit for, and in particular I remember with gratitude the important
help which he freely and promptly rendered to myself.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

in consequence of the option which now exists. The story is as follows. ‘One
day, when I had not a shilling which I could spare, I was passing by a cottage not
far from Keswick, where a letter-carrier was demanding a shilling for a letter,
which the woman of the house appeared unwilling to pay, and at last declined to
take. I paid the postage, and when the man was out of sight, she told me that
the letter was from her son, who took that means of letting her know that he was
well; the letter was <i>not to be paid for</i>. It was then opened and found to be
blank!” (“Letters, Conversations, and Recollections of S. T. Coleridge,”
Vol. II., p. 114).</p>

<p>In Miss Martineau’s “History of England During the Thirty Years’ Peace,”
which was published thirteen years after “Post Office Reform,” this story appears
in the following shape:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Rowland Hill, when a young man, was walking through the Lake
District, when he one day saw the postman deliver a letter to a woman at a
cottage door. The woman turned it over and examined it, and then returned it,
saying that she could not pay the postage, which was a shilling. Hearing that the
letter was from her brother, Mr. Hill paid the postage, in spite of the manifest
unwillingness of the woman. As soon as the postman was out of sight, she
showed Mr. Hill how his money had been wasted, as far as she was concerned.
The sheet was blank. There was an agreement between her brother and herself,
that as long as all went well with him, he should send a blank sheet in this way
once a quarter, and she thus had tidings of him without expense of postage. Most
people would have remembered this incident as a curious story to tell; but Mr.
Hill’s was a mind which wakened up at once to a sense of the significance of the
fact. There must be something wrong in a system which drove a brother and
sister to cheating, in order to gratify their desire to hear of one another’s welfare,
&amp;c.” Vol. II., p. 425.</p>

<p>A few years ago Sir R. Hill drew my attention to the blunder into which Miss
Martineau had fallen. The following is my note of what he said:—“He remarked
on her carelessness, and the trouble it had cost him. He had sent her,
on her application, his pamphlet. She read it carelessly. The story Miss
Martineau tells is, in the pamphlet, told of Coleridge. He (Sir R. Hill) had been
attacked in some of the papers for taking credit to himself for charity. Cornewall
Lewis asked him one day whether he had seen an attack on him in ‘Notes and
Queries.’ On his answering ‘No,’ he showed it him, and undertook to answer it
himself. The story was so believed and amplified, that a friend of his, when
travelling in the Lake District, was shown the very room in an inn where Rowland
Hill had first thought of penny postage.”</p>

<p>I am informed that two old ladies who lived in No. 1, Orme Square, Bayswater,
used to show to their friends the room in which Rowland Hill devised Penny
Postage, though he only took that house in 1839, a few months before the
Penny Postage Act was passed.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

of taxation. It occurred to me that probably some ease might be given to the
people by lowering the postal rate, and I discussed the subject with members of
my family. My brother Matthew, who was expecting Mr. Parker, (M.P. for
Sheffield, one of the Lords of the Treasury), to dine at his house, invited me to
meet him. Leading the conversation to the reduction of taxation, he said my
attention had been turned to the subject, and I explained to Mr. Parker the
method of relief that had occurred to me. Afterwards, at my brother’s suggestion,
I wrote down my views, the whole not exceeding three or four pages of foolscap.
Although occupied with other affairs, the reduction in the postal rate was not then
dismissed from my thoughts. The interest it had excited induced me to read
Reports, &amp;c., on postal administration, and it was in the perusal of their contents
that the question arose in my mind, whether the cost of a letter was affected by the
distance it had to be conveyed.”—Note of a conversation with Sir R. Hill two
or three years before his death, by Miss F. Davenport-Hill.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

not to make my estimate too low I had made it considerably too high; and I
think the history of this rectification too curious and characteristic to be omitted.
Two years later, the Parliamentary Committee appointed to consider my plan
ordered, at my suggestion, a return on the subject; when, to my surprise and
amusement, the report of the Post Office gave as the cost of this mail the exact
sum estimated by me, viz., £5. Struck with the coincidence, the more so as I had
intentionally allowed for possible omission, I suggested the call for a return in
detail; and, this being given, brought down the cost to £4 8s. 7¾d. In the
return, however, I discovered an error, viz., that the charge for guards’ wages
was that for the double journey instead of the single; and when this point was
adjusted, in a third return, the cost sank to £3 19s. 7¾d. When explanation of
the anomaly was asked for, it was acknowledged by the Post Office authorities
that my estimate had been adopted wholesale.—<i>Appendix to Second Report of

to Mr. Frederic Hill, most fittingly comes in here. It was written, indeed, a few
days after Sir Rowland Hill’s death, but the writer was carried back in his
thoughts to the earliest days of the great struggle for postal reform, in which he
himself had played no mean part:—</p>

<p>... “His time, probably from fulness of years, had arrived for leaving us.
Still those who appreciated his rare qualities, and the great service he had rendered
the country, liked to think that he was yet amongst them, and could observe,
with justifiable pride, the continued and increasing success of his great and beneficial
scheme.... I remember well, indeed, the frequent communications
I had with your brother when he was first bringing his plan before the public, and
also (to his honour) the great disinterestedness that he showed when he requested
me to submit the scheme then in MS. to the Government, offering to allow them
to have the entire credit of its introduction, if they chose to undertake it,
stipulating only that, if they should refuse, he should then refer it to the Press,
and make it known to, and understood by, the country. The apprehensions that
were then expressed at head-quarters (when I executed his commission) are still
fresh in my recollection, and most certainly was he left free to do what he liked
about a measure that, in their view, would require such a sacrifice of revenue,
and the success of which was so extremely problematical. I always considered
it fortunate (with regard to its success) that the measure was thus left to the
unbiassed judgment of the public, and to the energetic support which such men
as Grote, Warburton, and Hume, and the really intelligent reformers, then in the
House, gave to your brother.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

the Government of the plan of penny postage which had been made known to the
public by Mr. Rowland Hill. I said I thought the plan very ingenious, and likely
to confer great benefits upon the public, but that it would make a temporary
deficit in the revenue, which would probably require to be filled up by new
taxation. Mr. Warburton said that a new tax was a great evil, and he hoped
it would be avoided. No further conversation passed at that time. Unfortunately
the Government adopted both parts of Mr. Warburton’s advice. The Cabinet
was unanimous in favour of the ingenious and popular plan of a penny postage;
but they ought to have enacted at the same time such measures as would have
secured a revenue sufficient to defray the national expenditure. Failing to do this,
there was for three years together a deficit, which exposed the Government to the
powerful reproaches and unanswerable objections of Sir Robert Peel. Public
opinion echoed those reproaches and those objections, and produced such a degree
of discontent as was in itself a sufficient ground for a change of Administration.”—Extract

which he was to present with so remarkable an accuracy. His manner in those
days—his slowness and hesitating speech—were not recommendatory of his
doctrine to those who would not trouble themselves to discern its excellence and
urgent need. If he had been prepossessing in manner, and fluent and lively in
speech, it might have saved him half his difficulties, and the nation some delay;
but he was so accurate, so earnest, so irrefragable in his facts, so wise and
benevolent in his intentions, and so well-timed with his scheme, that success was,
in my opinion, certain from the beginning; and so I used to tell some conceited
and shallow members and adherents of the Whig Government, whose flippancy,
haughtiness, and ignorance about a matter of such transcendent importance tried
my temper exceedingly. Rowland Hill might and did bear it; but I own I
could not always. Even Sydney Smith was so unlike himself on this occasion, as
to talk and write of ‘this nonsense of a penny postage.’.... Lord Monteagle,
with entire complacency, used to smile it down at evening parties, and lift his eyebrows
at the credulity of the world which could suppose that a scheme so wild
could ever be tried.... The alteration in Rowland Hill himself, since he won
his tardy victory, is an interesting spectacle to those who knew him twenty years
ago. He always was full of domestic tenderness and social amiability; and these
qualities now shine out, and his whole mind and manners are quickened by the
removal of the cold obstruction he encountered at the beginning of his career.
Grateful as I feel to him as the most signal social benefactor of our time, it has
been a great pleasure to me to see the happy influence of success on the man himself.
I really should like to ask the surviving Whig leaders all round what they
think now of ‘the nonsense of the penny postage.’”—“Harriet Martineau’s

being how many letters may be delivered within a given time, the postage being
paid in the price of the envelopes, or paper. So all who wish well to the plan
are having slips in their doors. It is proved that poor people <i>do</i> write, or get
letters written, <i>wherever</i> a franking privilege exists. When January comes round,
do give your sympathy to all the poor pastors’, and tradesmen’s and artizans’
families, who can at last write to one another as if they were all M.P.’s. The

<p><a name="Footnote_294" id="Footnote_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_294"><span class="label">[294]</span></a> I have received from an esteemed correspondent the following cutting from the
City article of one of the London Daily Papers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“MONEY MARKET AND CITY INTELLIGENCE.</p>

<p class="date">“Friday Evening.</p>

<p>“Considerable diversion was created in the City to-day by the appearance of
the new penny-post devices for envelopes, half-sheet letters, and bits of ‘sticking
plaster,’ about an inch square, for dabbing on to letters. The surface of the
latter is filled up with a bust of Her Majesty, or what is guessed to be intended
for such, but which is much too vulgar of expression so to be mistaken by any of
the loyal subjects who have had the good fortune to see the graceful original herself.
But for this unlucky perversion of the royal features, the penny-post
‘sticking-plaster’ might appropriately have come into fashion and superseded
the court sticking-plaster, so common for the concealment of trifling cutaneous
cracks on the face of beauty. Thus women and men, too, might have carried
sovereigns on their countenances as well as in their hearts and purses, and many
a decayed beauty might have refreshed her faded charms with the renovating
representation of royal youth and loveliness. It is shrewdly suspected that this
untoward disfiguration of the royal person has been the studied work of ministerial
malevolence and jealousy, desirous of rendering their royal benefactress, if
possible, as odious as themselves. The envelopes and half-sheets have an engraved
surface, extremely fantastic, and not less grotesque. In the centre, at the
top, sits Britannia, throwing out her arms, as if in a tempest of fury, at four
winged urchins, intended to represent post-boys, letter-carriers, or Mercuries, but
who, instead of making use of their wings and flying, appear in the act of striking
out or swimming, which would have been natural enough if they had been furnished
with fins instead of wings. On the right of Britannia there are a brace of
elephants, all backed and ready to start, when some Hindoo, Chinese, Arabic, or
Turkish merchants, standing quietly by, have closed their bargains and correspondence.
The elephants are symbolic of the lightness and rapidity with which
Mr. Rowland Hill’s penny post is to be carried on, and perhaps, also, of the
power requisite for transporting the £1,500 a-year to his quarters, which is all he
obtains for strutting about the Post Office, with his hands in his pockets, and
nothing to do like a fish out of water. On the left of Britannia, who looks herself
very much like a termagant, there is an agglomeration of native Indians,
Missionaries, Yankees, and casks of tobacco, with a sprinkling of foliage, and the
rotten stem of a tree, not forgetting a little terrier dog inquisitively gliding
between the legs of the mysterious conclave to see the row. Below, on the left,
a couple of heads of the damsel tribe are curiously peering over a valentine just
received (scene, Valentine’s Day), whilst a little girl is pressing the elders for a
sight of Cupid, and the heart transfixed with a score of arrows. On the right
again stands a dutiful boy, reading to his anxious mamma an account of her
husband’s hapless shipwreck, who, with hands clasped, is blessing Rowland Hill
for the cheap rate at which she gets the disastrous intelligence. At the bottom of
all there is the word ‘Postage,’ done in small upon a large pattern of filagree
work. With very great propriety the name of the artist is conspicuously placed
in one corner, so that the public and posterity may know who is the worthy
Oliver of the genius of a Rowland on this triumphant occasion. As may well be
imagined, it is no common man, for the mighty effort has taxed the powers of the
Royal Academy itself, if the engraved announcement of W. Mulready, R.A., in
the corner may be credited. Considering the infinite drollery of the whole, the
curious assortment of figures and faces, the harmonious <i>mélange</i> of elephants,
mandarin’s tails, Yankee beavers, naked Indians, squatted with their hind-quarters
in front, Cherokee chiefs, with feathered tufts, shaking missionaries by the
hand; casks of Virginia threatening the heads of young ladies devouring their
love letters, and the old woman in the corner, with hands uplifted, blessing Lord
Lichfield and his Rowland for the saving grace of 11<i>d.</i> out of the shilling, and
valuing her absent husband’s calamity or death as nothing in comparison with such
an economy—altogether, it may be said, this is a wondrous combination of
pictorial genius, after which Phiz and Cruikshank must hide their diminished heads,
for they can hardly be deemed worthy now of the inferior grade of associates and
aspirants for academic honours. Withal the citizens are rude enough to believe
that these graphic embellishments will not go down at the price of 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> the
dozen for the envelopes, and half or quarter sheets, for the size is somewhat of the
mongrel sort, and of 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> per dozen for the bits of ‘sticking plaster,’ with a
head upon it which looks something like that of a girl, but nothing of a Queen.
As a very tolerable profit may be made out of the odd pence thus charged
over the stamp, the penny-postman calculates, no doubt, to make up the deficit
in the Post Office revenue by the sale of these gimcrack pictures for babes and
sucklings.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

to substitute some other stamp for that designed by Mulready, which is abused
and ridiculed on all sides. In departing so widely from the established ‘lion and
unicorn’ nonsense, I fear that we have run counter to settled opinions and
prejudices somewhat rashly. I now think it would have been wiser to have
followed established custom in all the details of the measure where practicable.”—May

Lord Granville, our ambassador, who, not understanding the matter, very properly

previous to his retirement from office, he intimated to you his intention of continuing
your employment by the Government, which was originally limited to two years,
for another year, ending the 14th September next. I had much pleasure in

safely be dispensed with, I take the opportunity of apprising you that I do not consider
it advisable to make any further extension of the period of your engagement

representing him as the chief obstacle to colonial reform; and I must confess that
it was under this prejudice that I began my intercourse with him. Soon, however,
I saw reason to doubt the soundness of such views—certainly they received no
confirmation whatever in his treatment of South Australia. He invariably received
me and my suggestions—some of which departed widely from ordinary routine—in
a friendly spirit, and the result of several years of intimate official communication
with him, was that I formed a very high estimate of his character.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

as a record of my feelings during the Parliamentary Inquiry of 1843, and of the
facts which produced them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">“Orme Square, Bayswater,<br />
“August 12th, 1843.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The scenes of yesterday, and your part in them, will form my justification
for the unusual course which I am taking.</p>

<p>“The open display of your hostility would not alone have moved me to it;
but, unhappily, that hostility has taken a form which, if persisted in, will most
effectually suppress the greater part of my evidence in reply. You will be aware
that I refer not merely to the perpetual interruptions which I receive, but the
contradiction of my testimony, of which those interruptions so frequently consisted.</p>

<p>“Sir, I must use the freedom of reminding you of the positions in which we
respectively stand. I have appealed to Parliament against the Treasury Board
of which you are an active member. This appeal is now trying before a Committee
of which you are chairman. You are, therefore, already a party and a
judge. If you desire to add to these characters that of witness, I have no power
to object; and, if I had the power, I should be far from wishing to exercise it.</p>

<p>“When you present yourself as a witness your statements will be sifted by cross-examination,
and I should evince a distrust of my own evidence if I could wish
to throw any obstacle in the way of such a proceeding. But I must object—most
earnestly object—to your giving evidence while in the act of examining me.
Such a course is monstrous in itself, and can only lead to a repetition of personal
altercation, to which, although it has been forced upon me, I cannot revert
without a deep sense of humiliation. Such courses are foreign to my habits and
most repugnant to my feelings.</p>

<p>“Be pleased, Sir, to recollect that the result of this investigation is of vital
importance to the public and to myself, and that I am contending single-handed
against the whole force of Government. If you have the slightest confidence in
the justice of your cause, you will not deny me the full benefit of the very brief
period which is allotted to me for my evidence in reply to the numberless misstatements
(as I maintain them to be) which I anxiously desire to answer.
Depend upon it, I have every motive to be as short as I can be with justice to
myself. The treatment which I have received will make the termination of this
inquiry a most welcome relief.</p>

<p>“If, however, it should still be your pleasure to subject me to the annoyances
which I have endured, I must beg leave to state that, after much thought, I have
come to this resolution: I will answer any question, however insulting, and will
reply to any statement, whatever imputation it may convey, provided the question
and statement, together with its answer, are permitted to make part of the
evidence on the short-hand writer’s notes. Let the House of Commons see the
<i>animus</i> which prompts the treatment of which I complain, and I shall not
despair of redress sooner or later; but I shall steadfastly decline answering
whenever the short-hand writer is ordered to desist from recording. I know of
no right which any member has to subject me to an examination which is to be
kept back from the House. I regret I did not act on this principle from the
first. Probably the knowledge that an offensive examination would be recorded
would have been quite sufficient to prevent its being made.</p>

Birmingham, October 2nd, 1832,” shows at once his interest in Astronomy, and
his practical knowledge of the subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,—You, like myself, will probably be asked questions about the
comet now talked of as visible. I have just found an account of its movements in
the Supplement of the “Nautical Almanac” for this year, page 43rd. I find on
calculation that it will be to-night on one side, and to-morrow night on the other
side, of a star marked on my globe θ Geminorum. I do not find the star in any
of my catalogues—no doubt it is in Wilkinson’s, if I could find time to consult it
at the New Library. Its right ascension is at present about 6 hours 39 minutes.
Its declination about 30° N. It will be found betwixt the Twins and Capella,
much nearer to the Twins. The comet is moving forward at about 7 minutes of
right ascension per day, and approaching the ecliptic and the equator 27´ of
declination daily. These movements will shortly bring it betwixt the Twins,
namely, about the 10th October, at about ¼ of the space from Castor and ¾
from Pollux. I cannot advise dependence on these calculations as exact. I have
corrected them by allowing for the errors of prediction as found by some observations
quoted from the <i>Atlas</i> newspaper of 30th instant, and have done my best.
The course points towards Regulus, which will be found within about 1½° on
the 1st November, the comet on the south.</p>

<p>“By these indications, and the help of your telescope, I hope you may find
it out.</p>

<p class="starbreak">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“P.S.—Will you oblige me by procuring me the means of studying the course
of the present comet. I find it called Biela’s comet in the <i>Atlas</i>—the comet of
6·7 years in the ‘Nautical Almanac.’ I mean of knowing what is known by
others of its history.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
